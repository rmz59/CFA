\section{Reading 9: Correlation and Regressions}
\subsection{Sample covar and sample correlation coefficients}
Sample covariance: $cov_{x,y}=\sum_i \frac{(X_i-\bar X)(Y_i-\bar Y)}{n-1}$
\\Sample correlation coeff: 
$r_{x,y}=\frac{cov_{x,y}}{s_x s_y}$, where $s_x$ is the sample dev of X.
\subsection{Limtations to correlations analysis}
Outliers: The results will be affected by extreme data points.(outliers)\\
Spurious correlation: There might be some non-zero corrlation coeff, but 
acutally they have no correlation at all.\\
Nonlinear relationships: Correlation only describe the linear relastions.
\subsection{Hypothesis: determine if the population 
correlation coefficient is zero}
Two-tailed hypothesis test:
$$
H_0: \rho=0, H_a: \rho \neq 0
$$
Assume that the two populations are {\bf normally} distrubited, then we 
can use t-test:
$$
t=\frac{r\sqrt{n-2}}{1-r^2}
$$:
Reject $H_0$ if  $t>+t_{critical}$ or $t<-t_{critical}$. Here,$r$ is the
sample correlation. Remember, you need to check t-table to find the t-value.
\subsection{Determine dependent/indepedent variables in a linear regression}
{\bf Simple linear regression}: Explain the variation in a dependent variable 
in terms of the variabltion in a single indepedent variable.
{\bf Independent variables} are called explanatory variable, the exogenous 
variable, or the predicting variable. 
{\bf Dependent variable} is also called the explained variable, the endogenous 
variable, or the predicted variable.
\subsection{Assumptions in linear regression and interpret regression coeff.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assumptions of linear regression:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Linear relationship must exist.
            \item The indepedent variable is uncorrelated with residuals.
            \item Expected Residual term is value. $E(\epsilon)=0$
            \item variance of the residual term is const. $E(\epsilon_i^2)=
                \sigma_\epsilon^2$. Otherwise, it will be "heteroskedastic"
            \item The residual term is independently distributed. otherwise -- "auto correlation"" 
                $E(\epsilon_i\epsilon_j)=1$    
            \item The residual term is normally distributed.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Simple Linear Regression Model
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Model: $Y_i=b_0+b_1X_i+\epsilon_i$, where $i=1...n$, and $Y_i$ is 
     the actual observed data.
            \item The fitted line, the line of best fit
                : $\hat{Y}=\hat{b_0}+\hat{b1}X_i$. Where $\hat{b_0}$
                is the estimated parameter of the model.
            \item How to choose the best fitted line? {\bf Sum of squared errors}
                 is minimum.
                 $$
                    \hat{b_1} = \frac{cov_{x,y}}{sigma_x^2}
                 $$
                 where $X$ is the indepdent variable. $\hat{b_1}$ is 
                 "regression coeffcient".
                 $$
                    \hat{b_0} = \bar Y - \hat{b_1}\bar X
                 $$
                 where $\bar X, \bar Y$ are the mean.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Interpreting a regression coefficient: Similar to basic ideas of 
        "slope". Keep in mind: any conclusion regarding this parameter needs 
        the statistical significance of the slope coefficient.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Standard error of estimate, the coeff. of determination and a 
confidence interval for a regression coefficient.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Standard error of estimate (SEE): Standard deviation between $Y_{estimate}$
        and $Y_{actual}$. - Smaller: better
    \item Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)
        The percentage of the total variance in the dependent variable that is 
        predictable from the indepedent variable. - One indepdent variable: $R^2=r^2$,
        where $r^2$ is the square of correlation coefficient.
    \item Regression Coefficient confidence interval
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hypothesis: $H_0: b_1=0 \Leftrightarrow H_a: b_1\neq 0$ 
            \item Confidence interval:
                $\hat{b_1}-(t_c s_{\hat{b_1}})<b_1<\hat{b_1}+(t_c s_{\hat{b_1}})$ 
            $s_{\hat{b}_1}$ is the standard error of the regression coeffi.  
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hypothesis: Determine if $\hat{b}_1=b_1$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item t-test statistic: $t_{b_1}=\frac{\hat{b}_1 - b_1}{s_{\hat{b}_1}}$
    \item Reject: if $t>+t_{critical}$ or $t<-t_{critical}$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate the predicted value for the depedent variable}
If an estimated regression model is known, $\hat{Y}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 X_p$
\subsection{Calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the predicted 
value of the depedent variable}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Eq: $\hat{Y}\pm(t_c s_f)$, where $s_f$ is the {\color{red}std error of the forecast.}
    \item $s_f^2=SEE^2 \left[1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(X-\bar X)^2}{(n-1)s_x^2} \right]$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $SEE^2=$ variance of the residuals
            \item $s_x^2=$ variance of the indepdent variable
            \item $X =$ value of the independent variable where the forecast was
                made.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{ANOVA in regression. Interpret results, and calculate F-statistic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the total variability 
        of the depedent variable. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Total sum of squares(SST): $SST=\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar Y)^2$
                \\SST is the total variation in the depedent variable.
                $Variance=SST/(n-1)$
            \item Regression sum of squares(RSS): $RSS=\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{Y}_i-\bar Y)^2$
                \\RSS is the explained variation.
            \item Sum of squared errors(SSE): $SSE=\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)^2$
                \\SSE is the unexplained variation.
            \item {\color{red}$SST = RSS+SSE$ I cannot get this equation yet}
                You need to know how to use these squares.
            \item Degree of freedom: i) Regression(Explained): $k=1$, since we only
                estimate one parameters.
                ii) Error(Unexplained) $df=n-k-1=n-2$
                iii) Total variation $df=n-1$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Calculating $R^2$ and {\bf SEE}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $R^2=explained variation/total varn=RSS/SST$
            \item $\bf{SEE}=\sqrt\frac{SSE}{n-2}$ {\bf SEE} is the std deviation of the
                regression error terms.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item The F-Statistic: used to explain whether {\it at least one} indepdent parameter
        can significanly explain the dependent parameter.  
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item F-statistic eq: $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}=\frac{RSS/k}{SSE/n-k-1}$
                 where $MSR=$ mean regression sum of squares.
                       $MSE=$ mean squared errors. 
                       Note: \color{red}{One tailed test!}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item F-statistic with one independent variable.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hypothesis: $H_0: b1=0 \Leftrightarrow H_a: b1\ne 0$
            \item degree of freedom: $df_{rss}=k=1,df_{sse}=n-k-1$
            \item Decision rule: reject $H_0$ if $F>F_c$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations of regression analysis}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parameter instability: the estimation eq may not be useful for other times.
        \item Limited usefulness: other participants may also use the same eq.
        \item Assumptions does not hold: i) Heteroskedastic, i.e., non-const
            variance of the error terms. ii) autocorrelation, i.e., error terms
            are not independent.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Reading 10: Multiple Regression and Issues in Regression Analysis}
Some basic ides
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Model: 
            $Y_i=b_0+b_1 X_{1i}+b_2 X_{2i}+...+b_k X_{ki}+\epsilon_i$
        \item Multiple regression methodology estimates the intercept and 
            slope coefficients so that $\sum_i^n \epsilon_i^2$ is minimized.
    \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Interpret estimated regression coefficients and their p-values.}
They are just simple linear functions with multiple parameters. Ignore.
\subsection{Formulate a null/alternative hypothesis, do correspoding calculations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hypothesis Testing of Regression coefficient. (Multi-parameters). \\
        Use t-statistics to determine if one parameter significantly contribute
        to the model.
        $$
            t=\frac{\hat{b}_j-b_j}{s_{\hat{b}_j}}, df=n-k-1
        $$
        where $k$ is the number of regression coefficients, and $1$ corresponds to
        the intercept term, and $s_{\hat{b}_j}$ is the coefficient standard error
        of $b_j$
    \item Determining statistical significance.
        \\ ``testing statistical significance" $\Rightarrow H_0: b_j=0, H_a: b_j\ne 0$
    \item Interpreting p-values.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Def: p-value is {\bf the smallest level of significance for 
                which the null hypothesis can be rejected.}
                \ If the p-value is less than significance level, the null 
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Other Tests of the Regression Coefficients: $H_0: a=$some value
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate and Interpret a confidence interval for the population 
value of a regression coefficient or a predicted value for the depedent variable
if an estimated regression model.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Confidence intervals for a regress. coeff.: $\hat{b}_j\pm(t_c\times s_{\hat{b}_j})$
    \item predicting the depedent variable: 
        $\hat{Y}_i=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 \hat{X}_{1i}+...+\hat{b}_k \hat{X}_{ki}$
        \\Even if you may conclude that some $b_i$ are not statistally significantly, you cannot
        treat them as $0$ and keep other parameters unchanged. You should use the
        original model, or you can throw $\hat{b}_k$ away and make a new regression model.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Assumptions of a multiple regresssion model}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear relationships exist.
    \item The independent variables are not random, and there is no exact linear relation
        between indepdent variables.
    \item $E[\epsilon|X_1,...,X_k]=0$
    \item Variance of $\epsilon=0$, i.e. $E[\epsilon_i]=0$
    \item $E(\epsilon_i\epsilon_j)=0$
    \item $\epsilon$ is normally distributed.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate and interpret F-statistic}
F-test: whether at least {\bf one} of the indepedent variables explains a significant
portion of the variation of the depedent variable. F test is a one-tail test.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H_0: b1=b2=b3=0 vs H_a:$ at least one $b_j\ne 0$
    \item $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}=\frac{RSS/k}{SSE/n-k-1}$
    \item Degree of freedom: $df_{numerator}=k, df_{denominator}=n-k-1$
    \item Rules: reject $H_0$ if $F(test-statistic)>F_c(critical value)$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Distinguish between $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item coefficient of determination $R^2$: used to test if a group of indepedent
        variable can explain the depedent variable: 
        \\$R^2=\frac{total variation - unexplained variation}{total variation}
        =\frac{SST-SSE}{SST}=\frac{RSS}{SST}$
        \\{\bf Multiple R} = $\sqrt{R^2}$
    \item Adjusted $R^2$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Note: $R^2$: {\color{red}{Overestimating}}: will increase as variables are added to the model.
        Even the marginal contribution of new variables are not statistically significant.
            \item Introduce $R_a^2$: $R_a^2=1-\left[\left(\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\right)\right](1-R^2)$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Evaluate the quality of a regression model by analyzing the ouput of the equation/ANOVA table}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ANOVA Tables, some important quantities
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $R^2=\frac{RSS}{SST}$
            \item $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}$ with $k$ and $n-k-1$ df
            \item Standard error of estimate:$SEE=\sqrt{MSE}$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Formulate a multiple regression with dummpy variables to represent qualitative factors}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Def: Some value is quite qualitative. Using dummy values like 0 or 1 
        to describe their impacts.
    \item Note: Pay attention to \# of dummy variables. If $n$ classes, we must use
        $n-1$ dummy variables.
    \item Interpreting the coefficients in a dummy variable regression. We can use F-statistics to
        test a group of parameters, or use t-test to test the individual slope coefficients.
    \item Example of Regression application with dummy variables. See Notes directly.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Why multiple regression isn't as easy as it looks?}
Pay attention to the assumptions that have been used. Violations like::
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Heteroskedasticity
    \item Serial correlation (auto-correlation)
    \item Multicollinarity
\end{enumerate}
Any violations on the assumptions will impact the estimation of SEE, and finaly 
change the t-statistic and F-statistic, and change the conclustion of the hypotesis
test.
\subsection{Types of Heteroskedasticity, how heteroskedasiticity and serial correlation affect inference}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is Heteroskedasticity?
        \\ {\bf Corresponding assumptions: Variance of the residuals is constant across observations. -- Homoskedasticity} 
        Heteroskedasity means the variance of the residuals is not equal.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unconditional heter: Not related to the level of the indepedent
                variables. Will not systematiclly increase with changes in the value
                of the indepedent variables. {\color{red}Usually will not casue major problems.}
            \item Conditional heter: Related to the level of the independent variables. Eg:
                Conditional heter exists if the variance of the residuals increase with 
                the value of the independent variables increases. {\color{red}Will cause big problems.}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Effect of Heteroskedasiticity on Regression Analysis
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unreliable standard errors.
            \item The coefficient estimates aren't affected.
            \item Will change the t-statistic, and will change the conclusion.
            \item Unreliable F-test
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Detect Heteroskedasicity
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Scatter plot
            \item Breusch-pagan test: $BP test = n\times R^2_{resid}$ with $df=k$. 
                where $n=$the number of observations, $R^2_{resid}$=$R^2$ from a second
                regression of the squared residuals from the first regression. $k=$the number
                of independent variables. If $R^2$ or BP-test are too large, something is wrong.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Correcting Heteroskedasticity
        \be
        \item Calculate robust sndard errors(White corrected std errors.). Use them for t-test.
            \item Generalized least squares. 
        \ee
    \item What is serial correlations?
        \be
            \item Def: auto-correlation, in which the residual terms are correlated.
                Common problem with time series data.
                \be
                    \item Positive serial correlation: a postive error in one time period will
                        increase the posibility to observe a positive one next time.
                    \item Negative serial correlation: Just opposite.
                \ee
            \item Effect: positive serial correlation will get small coefficient std errors. 
                Thus, too large t-statistics. therefore, too many Type I errors: reject the null
                hypothesis $H_0$ while it's actually true. 
            \item Detection:
                \be
                    \item Residual plots
                    \item Durbin-Watson statistics: 
                        $$
                        \color{red}DW=\frac{\sum_{t=2}^T (\hat{\varepsilon}_t-\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^T \hat{\epsilon}^2}
                        $$
                        For large samples, $DW\approx 2(1-r)$, where $r$ is the 
                        correlation coefficient between residuals from one period and thoese from the previous period.
                        \\Results: 
                        \be
                            \item $DW=2\Rightarrow$ Homoskedasitic and not serially correlated.
                            \item $DW<2\Rightarrow$ Postively serially correlated.
                            \item $DW>2\Rightarrow$ Negatively serially correlated.

                        \ee
                        Formulated hypothesis with DW-table, upper and lower critical values
                        \be
                            \item Hypothesis: $H_0:$ the regression has {\bf no}
                                positive serial correlation.
                            \item $DW<d_l$: positive serially correlated. Reject null.
                            \item $d_l<DW<d_u$: inconclusive results.
                            \item $DW>d_u$: {\bf There is no evidence that are positive correlated.} 
                        \ee
                \ee
            \item Correcting serial correlation:
            \be
                \item Adjust the coefficient std errors. {\bf recommended.} Using Hansen method.
                    \be
                        \item Serial correlation only: Hansen method. 
                        \item Heteroskedasticity only: White-corrected stand errors.
                        \item Both: Hans methods.
                    \ee
                \item Imporoe the specification of the model.
            \ee
    \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Multicolinearity and its cause and effects in regression analysis}
Multicollinearity: Indepedent variables or linear combinations of independent variables are highly
correlated.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Effect of Multicollinearity on Regression Analysis: Will increase the std errors of 
        the slope coefficients. {\color{red} Type II Error:
        A variable is significant, while we conclude it's not.} 
    \item Detecting: Common situation: $t-statistic$ is not significant while $F-test$ is significant.
        This tells us the indepedent variables are highly correlated.
        \\ A simple rule works if there are 2 indepedent variables: when the absolute value of the sample correlation betewen any two 
        indepedent variables in the regression is greater than 0.7.
    \item Correcting: omit one or more of the correlated indepedent variables. 
        THe problame is that it's hard to find the variables that result in the multicolinearity.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Model misspecification}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Defination of {\bf Regression model of specification}: decide which independent variables
        to be included in the model.
    \item Types of misspecification
        \be
            \item The functional form can be misspecified:
                important variables are ommited;variables should be transformed; data is improperly pooled.
            \item Explanatory variables are correlated with error term in time series model:
                A lagged dependent variable is used as an independent variable; a function of the dependent
                variable is used as an independent variable(forecasting the past);
                independent variables are measured with error.
            \item Other time-series misspecification.
        \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Models with qualitive dependent variables}
Include qualitative dependent variables, like default, bankcrupcy. Cannot use an 
ordinary regression model. Should use other models like {\bf probit and logit models}
or {\bf discriminant models}.
\be
\item Probit: normal distribution, give probability.
\item Logistic: logistic distribution. 
\item Discriminant: result in an overall score or ranking.

the estimated trend coefficients}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear Trend Model and Log-linear Trend
        \be
            \item Definition: $y_t=b_0+b_1(t)+\epsilon_t$ Note: $t$ is just time.
            \item Coefficients is determined by OLS. Ordinary least squared regression.
                \\$\hat{y}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1$
            \item Log-linear Trend Models
            \item Model: $y_t=\exp{b_0+b_1(t)}\Rightarrow \ln{y_t}=b_0+b_1(t)$
        \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear model trend 
should be used}
\be
    \item Factors that determine which model is best: plot data.
    \item Limitaions of trend models: 
        \be
            \item residuals are uncorrelated with each other.
        Otherwise, it will cause auto correlation and we should not use the trend model.
            \item For log-linear model, it is not suitable for cases with serial correlations (autocorrelation).
            \item Detect auto correlation: Durbin Watson statistic. $DW=2.0\Rightarrow$ No auto correlation.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Autoregressive model, requirements for covariance statinoary}
\be
    \item Autoregressive model:
        \be
            \item Model: $x_t=b_0+b_1 x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$
            \item Statistical inferences bse on ordinary least squares estimates doesn't
                apply unless the time series is {\bf covariance stationary}.
            \item Conditions for covariance stationary
                \be
                    \item Constant and finite expected value.
                    \item Constant and finite variance.
                    \item Constant and finite covariance between values at any given lag.
                \ee
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{An autogressive model of order $p$}
\be
    \item Model(order $p$): $x_t=b_0+b_1x_{t-1}+b_2x_{t_2}+...+b_px_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t$ 
    \item Forecasting with an autoregressive model: 
        \be
            \item One-period-ahead forecast for $AR(1)$: $\hat{x}_{t+1}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 x_t$
            \item Two-period-ahead forecast for $AR(1)$: $\hat{x}_{t+2}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 \hat{x}_{t+1}$
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{How the residuals can be used to test the autogressive model}
\be
    \item The residual should have no {\it serial correlation} if an AR model is correct.
    \item Steps
        \be
            \item Estimate: Start with AR(1)
            \item Calculate: the autocorrelations of he model residuals
            \item Test: whether the autoccorelations are signficantly different from 0.
                \\The standard error is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$ for $T$ observations. The t-test for each
                observation is $t=\frac{\rho_{\epsilon_t,epsilon_{t-k}}}{1/sqrt{T}}$, with $T-2$ df. 
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Mean reversion and a mean-reverting level}
\be
    \item Mean reversion: The time series tends to move toward its mean.
    \item Mean-reverting level: $\hat{x}_{t+1}=x_{t}$, where $\hat{x}_t$ is the predicted value. 
    \item All covariance stationary time series has finite mean-reverting level. 
\ee
\subsection{Contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and the forecasting accuracy of 
different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion.}
\be
    \item in-sample, out-of-sample: determined by if the predicted data is in the range of 
        the observations.
    \item RMSE, root mean squared error: used to compare the accurancy. If the accurancy of 
        out-of-sample is better, you should use it for future applications
\ee
\subsection{Explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models}
\be
    \item Instability or nonstationarity. Due to the dynamic econimic conditions, 
        model coefficients will change a lot from period to period. 
    \item Shorter time series are more stable, but longer time series are more reliable.
\ee
\subsection{Random walk processes and their comparisons between covariance stationary processes}
\be
    \item Random walk: $x_t=x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$
    \be
        \item $E(\varepsilon_t)=0$: The expected value of each error is zero.
        \item $E(\varepsilon_t^2)=0$: The variance of the error terms is constant.
        \item $E(\varepsilon_i,\varepsilon_j)=0$: There is no serial correlation in the error terms.
    \ee
    \item Random walk with a Drift: $x_t=b_0+b_1 x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$, where $b_1$=0
    \item A random walk or a random walk with a drift have no finte mean-reverting level.
        Since $b_1=1,\frac{b_0}{1-b_1}=\frac{b_0}{0}$. Therefore, they are not covariance stationary.
    \item $b_1=1$, they exhibit a unit root. Thus, {\bf the least square regression that been used in 
        AR(1) will not work unless we transfrom the data}.
\ee
\subsection{Things about unit roots: when they will occur, how to test them, how to transform data to apply AR}
\be
    \item Unit root testing for nonstationarity:
        \be
            \item run an AR model and check autocorrelations
            \item perform Dickey Fuller test.
                \be
                    \item Transform: $x_t=b_0+b_1x_1+\varepsilon\Rightarrow x_t-x_{t-1}=b_0+(b_1-1)x_{t-1}+\varepsilon$
                    \item Direct test if $b_1-1=0$ using a modified t-test.    
                \ee
        \ee
    \item First differencing
        \be
            \item For a random walk, transform the data $y_t=x_t-x_{t-1}\Rightarrow y_t=\varepsilon_t$
                then start to use an AR model $y=b_0+b_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon$, 
                where $b_0=b_1=0$
            \item $y$ is covariance stationary.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{How to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model, and 
calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a sesonal lag.}
\be
    \item Detect: special autocorrelation exists for some seasonal lags.
    \item Correction: Add an additional seasonal lag term.
\ee
\subsection{Explain autogressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe
how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series}
\be
    \item ARCH: the variance of the residuals in one period is dependent on the variance of
        the residuals in a previous period.
    \item Using ARCH models:
        \\Example $ARCH(1)$: $\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2=a_0+a_1\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+\mu_t$
        if $a_1$ is significantly different from zero. $\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2$ is the squared residuals.
        \\Note: Things like generalized least squares should me used to 
                correct heteroskedasticity. otherwise, the std errors of the 
                coefficients will be wrong, leading to invalid conclusions.
    \item Predicting the variance of a time series: using ARCH model to predict the variance of 

        future periods: $\hat{\sigma}^2_{t+1}=\hat{a}_0+\hat{a}_1\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2$
\ee
\subsection{Explain How time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before
use ain a linear regression}
\be
    \item Cointegration: 
        \be
            \item Two time series are economically linked or follow the 
        same trend and that relationship is not expected to change. -- Error terms 
        from regressing one on the other is covariance stationary and the t-test are reliable.
            \item How to test conintegration: regress $y_t$ on $x_t$ 
                 $y_t=b_0+b_1x_t+\varepsilon$, $y_t, x_t$ are two different time series.
                 Then do a unit root test using the Dickey Fuller test with critical t-values
                 calculated by Engle and Granger. 
                 \\If "A unit root" is rejected $\Rightarrow$ covariance stationary, cointegrated.

                    \item Portfolio Composion mechanism. Countries with current account surpluses
                        usually have capital account deficits, which typically take the form of investments
                        in countries with current account deficits. As a result of these flows of capital, investor
                        countries may find their portfolios' composition being dominated by few investee currencies. 
                        When investor countries decide to rebalance their investment portfolios, it can have a significant negative
                        impact on the value of those investee country currencies.

                        by borrowing money from other countries. If the debt too high, lenders may question
                        the security, leading to the deprecitaion of the borrower's currency.

\section{Economic Growth and the Investment Decision}
\subsection{Compare factors favoring and limiting economic growth in developed and developing economies}
Two important factors. 1: GDP per capita. 2: Growth of GDP
\be
    \item Preconditions for Growth
        \be
            \item Saving and investment. Positively correlated with economic development.
            \item Financial markets and intermediaries. Help resources reallocation. 
                However, it may increase leverage, risks.
            \item Political stability, rule of law and property rights.
            \item Investment in human capital. Worker's skills.
            \item Tax and regulatory systems. Lower tax burdens are good.
                Lower regulation levels are good.
            \item Free trade and unrestriced capital flows.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe the relation between the long-run rate of stock market appreciation and
the sustainable groth rate of economy.}
The growth in the price is related to earnings and GDP: 
$\Delta_P=\Delta_GDP + \Delta(E/GDP)+\Delta(P/E)$.
Over the long-term, $\Delta(E/GDP)=0,\Delta(P/E)=0$. Only GDP growth matters.
\subsection{Explain why potential GDP and its growth rate matter for equity and fixed income investors.}
Higer GDP growth\ra Higher interest rates \ra Higer real asset returns.\\
Higher GDP growth makes people think that future income is increasing, therefore increase consumptions
and reduce savings. To encourage consumers save, higher interest rate is needed.

In short term, actual GDP in excess of potential GDP will result in rising prices \ra inflationary pressure.
\subsection{Distinguish between capital deepening investment and technological progress and explain
how each affects economic growth and labor productivity}
\be
    \item Factor input and Economic growth
        \be
            \item Model: 2-factor aggregate production: Y~F(L,K) at a level of tech T.
                Output Y is a function of labor(L) and capital.
            \item Cobb-Douglas Production: $Y=TK^\alpha L^{(1-\alpha)}$
                \\Dividing both sides by $L$, the output per worker is 
                $$
                    Y/L=T(K/L)^\alpha

        $$
        \Delta Y/Y=\Delta A/A+\alpha\times(\Delta K/K)+(1-\alpha)(\Delta L/L)
        $$
        i.e. growth rate in potential GDP = long-term growth of tech 
        + $\alpha$ long-term growth rate of capital
         + (1-$\alpha$)*(long-term growth rate of labor)
        \\ The growth of technology is not observable. Can be estimated from previous
        data: ex-growth rate - ex-growth rate from L and K
\ee
\subsection{Explain how natural resources affect economic growth and evaluate the arument
that limited availability of natural resources constrains economic growth}
\be
    \item Access to natural resouces does not require ownership of resources.
    \item Another theory: ownership of natural resources may actually inhibit growth. 
        \ra Dutch disease: global demand for natural resouces  drives up the coutries
        currency, making all other exports more expensive and uncompetitive.

\subsection{Explain how demographics, immigration, and labor force participation
affect the rate and sustainability of economic growth}
\be
    \item Labor Supply Factors
        \be
            \item Demographics: A countries age distribution. Countries with younger
                age will have a higher potential growth.
            \item Labor force participation.
            \item Immigration: a potential source in developed countries \Ra increase work force
            \item Average hours worked
        \ee

\subsection{Explain how investment in physical capital, human capital, and technological
development affects economic growth}
\be
    \item Human capital: knowledge and skills that individuals possess. Can be enhanced
        via education.
    \item Physical capital: infrastructure, computers, telecommunications(ICT)
        AND non-ICT capital(machineary, transportation and non-residential construction).
        More investment in physical capital \Ra Good GDP growth.
        \\ MOre investment may enhance the tech improvements.
    \item Technological development. Investment in tech will increase the productivity.
    \item Public infrastructure: like roads, bridges, and municipal facilities. 
        This will enhance total productivity. Because the private investment will not
        invest these public things for their little returns.
\ee
\subsection{Compare classical growth theory, neoclassical growth theory, and endogenous
growth theory}
\be
    \item Classical growth theory: In the long-term, population growth increases whenever
        there are increases in per capita income above subsistence level due to increase
        in capital or tech progress. \Ra Growth in real GDP per capita
        is not permanant. \Ra This is not supported by observed facts.
    \item Neoclassical Growth theory:
        \be
            \item Estimate steady state growth rate. Equilibrium economy is when the output-to-capital
                ratio is constant. When the output-capital ratio is constant, the labor-to-capital
                ratio and output per capita also grow at the equilibrium rate. Check textbooks here.
            \item Based on Cobb-Douglas function, 
                \be
                    \item Sustainable growth of output per capita: $g^\ast=\frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}$,
                        where $\theta$ is the growth rate in techonology, and $1-\alpha$ 
                        is the labor's share of GDP.
                    \item Sustainable growth rate: $G^\ast=\frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}
                        +\Delta_L$, which is the growth rate of output per  capita plus
                        the growth of labor.
                    \item Comments
                        \be
                            \item Caital deepening will not affet the growth rate in the long run.
                        \ee
                \ee
        \ee
    \item Endogenous Growth Theory
        \be
            \item Technological growth is a result of investment in physical and human capital. Returns to capital are constant.
            \item Private investments in R\&D also benefits all economy.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Explain and evaluate convergence hypoteses}
\be
    \item Absolute convergence: Less developed countries will achieve equal living standards
        overtime.
    \item Conditional convergence: Convergence in living standards will only occur for countries with the same savings rates, population
        growth rates and production functions. 
    \item Club convergence: Countries may be part of a club. Poorer countries that are part of the club will catch up
        their richer peers. Institutional changes can help a country to join the club. 
        Those are not in the club will never catch up.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the economic rationale for governments to provide 
incentives to private investments in technology and knowledge.}
R\&D are risky. Governments support may provide incentives to private R\&D, and therefore
boosts the growth of the overall economy.
\subsection{Describe the expected impact of removing trade barriers on capital investment 
and profits, employment and wages, and growth in the economies involved.}
\be
    \item Increased investment from foreign savins
    \item Allows focus on industries where the country has advantage.
    \item Increased markets
    \item Increased sharing of tech
    \item Increased competition removes bad firms and rellocating assets.

        including self-regulating organizations that regulates and represents their members.
        Outside bodies will not regulate, but their products are referenced by regulators.
\ee
\subsection{Describe uses of self-regulation in financial markets}
\be
    \item US: FINRA is an SRO recognized by SEC.
    \item In civil-law countries, independent SROs are rare, and government agencies
        fulfill the role of SROs.
    \item In common=law countries, independent SROs are historically good.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the economic rationale for regulatory intervention}
\be
    \item Economic Rationale for Regulation. Regulations are needed when
        \be 
            \item Information frictions. When information is not equally availabel or distributed.
            \item Externalities.

\ee
\subsection{Describe regulatory interdependencies and their effects.}
\be
    \item Regulatory Interdependencies.
        \be
            \item Regulatory capture theory: Regulators will at some point in time
                be influenced or controlled byt the industiry that is being regulated.
                Because the regulators will be influenced by the industry, and the
                experience will sometimes lead to impartial conclusions.
            \item Regulatory competition: Regulatory difference betweeen jurisdictions will lead to it.
                Regulators compete to provide the most business-friendly environment.
            \item Regulatory arbitrage: businesses find a coutry that best for itself.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe the tools of regulatory intervention in markets}
\be
    \item Price mechanisms
    \item Restricting/requiring certain activities. Ban certain activities or 
        require to perform some activities.
    \item Provision of public goods or financing private projects. 
\ee
\subsection{Explain purposes in regulating commerce and financial markets}
\be
    \item  Regulating commerce: Government regulations, including company laws, tax laws,
        contract laws, competition laws, banking laws, bankruptcy laws and dispute resolution systems.
        \\This laws may help or hinder commerce.
    \item REgulating financial markets: regulation of securities markets and regulation of 
                financial institutions. -- protecting investors, creating confidence in
                the markets, and enhancing capital formation.
        \be
            \item Regulation of security markets
            \item Regulation of Financial Institutions: Prudential supervision,
                the monitoring and regulation of financial institutions to reduce
                system-wide risks and to protect investors. Cost-benefit analysis should include
                hidden costs.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe anticompetitive behaviors targeted by antitrust laws globally and evaluate
the antitrust risk associated with a given business strategy.}
Antitrust regulation works to promote domestic competition. Like blocking a merger that leads to
excessive concentration of market share. International companies may be subject to antitrust
laws in different countries.
\subsection{Benefits and costs of regulation}
Costs include the implementation cost and the cost of the regulation to the private
sector.
{\it Regulatory burden}: the cost of compliance for the regulated entity. 
Regulatory burden - benefits that private sector receives = Net regulotry burden.
\subsection{Evaluate how a specific regulation affects and industry companly, or security}
\be
    \item Can help or hinder the industry or the company.
    \item Not necessarily always costly for those that being regulated.
    \item May introduce inefficiencies in the market. For example, government bailout of financial
        institutions may convey a message that companies will be helped. And the credit
        spreads will not fully reflect their risk.
    \item Certain industries have more exposure to certain types of regulations.

        :The PV of all future obligation, based on expected future salary increases.
        PVB will change from one period to the next.
        \be
            \item Current service cost: PV of benefits earned by during the current period.
            \item Interest cost: Increases in the obligation due to the passage of time.
                Interest will accrue. The cost = the pension obilgation at the beginning of
                the period times the discount rate.
            \item Past service costs: retroactive benefits awarded to employees when plan's changed.
                IFRS: expensed immediatedly. GAAP: ammortized over the average service life of 
                employees.
            \item Changes in actuarial assumptions: Gains/losses due to changes like mortality, 
                employee turnover, retirement age, and the discount rate.
            \item Benefits paid.
        \ee
    \item Balance Sheet Effects:
        \\Funded status = fair value of plan assets - PBO
        \\ Balance sheet asset(liability) = funded status. This is good for IFRS/GAAP.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the components of a company's defined benefit pension costs.}
\be
    \item Total periodic pension cost = employer contributions - (ending funded status - beginning funded status)
        \\TPPC = current service cost + interest cost - actual return on plan assets +/- actuarial losses,gains due
        to changes in assumptions affecting PBO + prior service cost.
    \item Periodic Pension Cost Reported in P\&L, i.e. Income stmt
        \be
            \item {\bf Current service cost}. Immediately recognized in income stmt.
                CSC is the increase in PBO since the employee worke one more period.
            \item {\bf Interest cost}. Immediately recognized. Increase in PBO due to the passage of time.
            \item {\bf Expected return on plan assets}. The return on the plan assets has no effect on the PBO.
                Use expected return to compute the reported pension expense. Difference
                in expected return and actual return are in "actual gains and losses"
                IFRS: expected rate of return is assumed = the discount rate to compute
                PBO.
            \item {\bf Actuarial gains and losses} Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.
                has 2 components. G/L due to changes
                in actuarial assumptions; difference in actual/expected return. 
                IFRS: not amortized. GAAP: amortized with corridor.
            \item {\bf Corridor Approach.} If G/L$>$10\% of max(begining PBO, plan assets),
                the excess amount should be amortized over the remaining service 
                life of employees. Time can be shorter if wanted, but consistent.
            \item {\bf Past(prior) service costs.} If pension plan is changed, the change
                reported in OCI. And amortized of the remainig life of affected employees. 
                In IFRS: changes are reported in income stmt instantly.

\subsection{Explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plan's assumptions on the 
defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost.}
3 Assumptions need disclosures.
\be
    \item {\bf Discount rate:} Interest rate to compute the PV of BO and the current service cost.
    \item {\bf Rate of compensation growth:} average annual increase rate of
        employee's compensation.
    \item {\bf Expected return on plan assets:} long-term rate of return on the plan's investments.
        Only good in GAAP, b/c in IFRS, it's equal to the discount rate.
\ee

To improve reports, a company
\be
    \item Increase the discount rate to reduce PBO, pension costs, and interest cost.
    \item Decrease the compensation growth rate to reduce futher benefit payments, PBO, and
        current service cost and interest cost.
    \item Increase the expected return on plan assets.
\ee
Ultimate healthcare trend rate: constant rate of a health care inflation.
\subsection{Explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other
post-employment benefits affect financial stmts and ratios.}
One need to pay attention to different assumptions when compare companies:
\be
    \item Gross vs. net pension assets/liabilities. ROA will be lower with gross
        pension A/L; leverage ratios will be higher.
    \item Differnces in assumptions used: like discount rates.
    \item IFRS, GAAP. 
    \item Difference due to classification in the income stmt. GAAP: the entire 
        periodic pension cost in P\&L, including interest are operating expense.
        IFRS: can be in various line items.
\ee
\subsection{Interpret pension plan note disclosures including cash flow related 
information.}
If the difference between cash flow and total periodic pension cost is material,
the difference can be reclassified from Operating activities to Financing activities.
\subsection{Explain issues associated with accounting for share-based compensation}
\be
    \item Forms: stock options and outright share grants.
    \item Recording: issues for stocks -- the value needs estimatings. 
    \item SHould be spread over the period for which they reward the employee.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects
financial stmts, and the importance of companies assumptions in valuing these grants
and options.}
IFRS and GAAP are similar.
\be
    \item {\bf Stock options.} Expense is based on the fair value of options. Spread over 
        the service time(grant date to the actual date that employees can act). Net income
        and retaining earnings will decrease, but total-equity will not change.
    \item {\bf Determining Fair Value.} If on-market, use market price.
        Otherwise, Using different models to find it.
    \item {\bf Stock grants.} Compensation expense is based on the fair value of
        the grant date. Allocated over the service period.
    \item {\bf Stock appreciation rights.} It's different from stock options. 
        It gives the employee the right to receive compensation based on the increase in the price
        of the firm's stock over some threshold. No shares are issued. No dillustion, but 
        the company needs to pay cash.
    \item {\bf Phantom stock.} Similar to stock appreciation rights. But is based on the 
        performance of hypothetical stock

\section{Reading 18: Multinational Operations}
\subsection{Distinguish among presentation currency, functional currency and local currency.}
\be
    \item Definition:
        \\-Local currency: currency of the country being referred to.
        \\-Functional currency: determined by the management. The main currency the company uses.
        \\-Presentation (reporting) currency: The currency the parent company prepares stmts
\ee
\subsection{Describe foreign currency transaction exposure, including accounting for and 
disclosures about foreign currency transaction gains and losses}
\be
    \item Foreign currency denominated transactions are measured in the presentation
        currency at the spot rate on the transaction date. Currency risk arises when the
        transaction date and payment date differ, leads to differnt spot rate.
    \item If balance sheet date occurs before the transaction is settled, recognize G/L in
        blance sheet, and unrealized G/L in income stmt. When the transaction settled,
        additional G/L may need to be recognized.
    \item Analyst Issues: G/L due to currency in income stmt may be in operating or non-operating
        income. B/c accounting std do not provide any guides. Pay attention to this.

\subsection{Analyze how changes in exchange rates affect the translated sales of the subsidiary
and parent company}
\subsection{Compare the current rate method and the temporal method, evaluate how each
affects the parent company's balance sheet and income stmt, and determine which method is 
appropriate in variuos scenarios.}
\be
    \item Methods to translante financial stmts of sub to parent reporting currency
        \\- Remeasurement: converting the local to functional currency with temporal method.
        \\- Translantion: convert functional currency to paraent's reporting currency
        using the currenty rate method.
        \\- Define appropriate translation method. See P64 in notes, new version.
        \\- More definitions. a) Current rate: the exchange rate on the balance sheet rate.
        b) Average rate: the average exchange rate over the reporting period. c). historical rate:
        the actual when the transactions occurs.
    \item Apply the current rate method process:
        \be
            \item All income stms are translate at the average rate.
            \item All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate 
                {\it except for common stock, at historical rate}.
            \item Dividends are at the rate that applied when they were declared.
            \item Translation G/L is reported in shareholder's equity as a part
                of the cumulative translation adjustment.
        \ee
    \item Applying the Temporal Method
        \be
            \item Monetary A/L(fixed in the amount of currency) remeasured using the current exchange rate.
            \item All other A/L are nonmonetary assets,  like inventory, fixed assets,
                intangible assets.for example, Unearned(deferred) revenue. They are 
                remeasured in hisotyrical rate. ({\it Exception: non-money A/L on the balance sheet
                at fair value are remeasured at the current rate}).
            \item Common stock, dividends paid are at historical rate.
            \item Expense related to nonmonetariy assets are remeasured based on the 
                historical rates at the time of purchase.
            \item Revenues and all other expenses are at the average rate.
            \item Remeasurement G/L is in income stmt. 
        \ee
    \item Inventory and COGS under the Temporal Method.
       \\ Numerous historical exchange rate needs to be remembered. Inventory
                are complicated. Inventory and COGS are remeasured at different rates in 
                FIFO/LIFO.
    \item Parents Company Exposure to Changing Exchange Rates
        \be
            \item In Current rate method: Exposure in the net asset position of the subsidiary.
            \item In Temporal method: net monetary A/L are exposed.
        \ee
    \item Calculating the Translation/Remeasurement G/L
        \\G/L is reported in CTA, and GTP  is used to make A=L+E.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the translation effects and evaluate the translation of a 
subsidiary's balance sheet and income }
\be
    \item -CR method: start with income stmt. As the net income here will be used 
        for the retained earnings in balance stmt.
        \\-Temporal method: start with blance stmt.
    \item Different results from CR and Temporal methods. Why?
        \be
            \item Income before translation G/L is different, due to the different 
                rate used for items. Example: COGS and depreciation, avearge rate
                in CR method and historical rate in Temporal.
            \item Translation G/L are different. Since net assets' are exposed to
                the depreciation of Local Currenty in CR, but net MONETARY assets
                are in temporal method.
            \item Net income is different. This is due to different exchange rate. Besides,
                in CR method, translation G/L are in CTA. In Temporal, remeasurement G/L are
                in income stmt.
            \item Total assets are different b/c inventory and net fixed assets are different.
        \ee
    \item

\subsection{Analyze how the current rate method and the temporal method affect financial 
statements and ratios.}
\be
    \item Pure Balance Sheet and pure Income Stmt ratios. PURE balance sheet and pure
        income statement ratios 
    \item Mixed Balance Sheet/Income Statement ratios. CR result in small changes.
        \\ Key points to remember
        \\ --Pure balance sheet/pure income ratios will be the same.
        \\ --If foreign currency is depreciating, translated mixed ratios (with
        income stmt in up and end-of-period balance sheet item down) will be larger.
    \item Compare ratios from Temporal method and current rate method. Compare the rates
        is the key.
        \be
            \item Determine whether the foreigen currency is appreciating/depre.
            \item which rates is on numberator or denominator.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Analyze how alternative translation methods for subsidiaries operating
in hyperinflationary economies affect financial stmts\& ratios}
\be
    \item Hyperinflation def. In FASB, cumulative infation $>$100\% over 3-yr
        period. IASB: doesn't have definition. But 100-3-yr is a good indication.
        Nonmonetary A/L are not affected by hyperinflation.
    \item GAAP: in hyperinflation, the parent's presentation currency is the functional
        currency. -- Temporal method 
    \item IFRS: foreigen currency stmts are restated for inflation, and then tranlated
        with CR method.
        \\--Nonmonetary A/L restated with price index.
        \\--Monetary A/L doesn't change.
        \\--Shareholder's equity are restated with price index.
        \\--Retained earnings, plug figure
        \\--Income stmt: times the change in the price index from the transaction
        date.
        \\--Net purchasing power G/L recognized in income stmt
        \\--Check the examples on P82, new notes, book2
    \item Analyzing Foreign Currency Disclosure
        \be
        \item
        --Multiple foreign subs may exist. And disclosure information are limited.
        Can be found in footnotes (financial stmt) and management discussion/analysis
        of the annual report.
        \\---Possiblie Solution:Add the change in CTA into netincome.
        \\---Also, can add the unrealized G/L to net income.
        \item 
        -- Clean-surplas accounting: add G/L that are reported in shareholder's
        equity to net income stmt.
        \\-- Dirty-surplus accounting: report G/L in shareholder's equity.

\subsection{Describe how multinational operations affect a company's effective tax rate}
\be
    \item Tax Implications of Multinational Operations
        \\--Effective tax rate: tax expense divided by pretax profit
        \\--Statutory tax rate: Provided by the tax code of the home country. 
        \\Companies needs to reconcile these two rates.
        \\Influence on the effective rate:

\subsection{Describe indicators of balance sheet quality}
\subsection{Evaluate the balance sheet quality of a company}
Completeness, unbiased measurement, clarity of presentation
\be
    \item Completeness
        \\- If off-balance-sheet liabilities exist, then need to restate the balance sheet.
        \\- Equity method can make certain ratios higher than acquisition method. If firms 
        use equity method rather than acquision method, then pay attention to it.
    \item Unbiased Measurement. Some subjectiveity:
        \\- Value of the pension liability, based on several assumptions
        \\- Value of investment in debt or equity of other companies for which
        a market vvalue is not available
        \\- Goodwill value
        \\- Inventory valuatoin
        \\- Impairment of PP\&E
    \item Clear Presentation
        \\A single-line item or items grouped together? Although standard 
        doesn't specify how much items must be presented. Clear presentation is good.

\section{Reading 20: Integration of Financial Statement Analysis Techniques}
\subsection{Demonstrate the use of a framework for the analysis of financial
statements, given a particular problem, question, or purpose. (e.g., valuing
equity based on comparables, critiquing a credit rating, obtaining a comprehensive
picture of financial leverage, evaluting the perspectives given in management's
discussion of financial results)}
Steps: in notebook.
\subsection{Identify financial reporting choices and biases that affect the quality
and comparability of companies' financial statements and explain how such biases may
affect financial decisions}
\be
    \item Sources of Earnings and Return on Equity: Use DuPont decomposition
        \be
            \item Use DuPont to find the performance drivers.
                $$
                ROE=\frac{NI}{EBT}\times \frac{EBT}{EBIT}\times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}
                \times \frac{revenue}{average assets}\times \frac{average}{average equity}
                $$
            \item Consider, if the income is generated internally or externally. Remove them
                from DuPont analysis.
            \item Rm pro-rata share of investee's earnings in influential investments.
            \item In equity method, Rm the carrying value of investments in balance sheet.
        \ee
    \item Asset Base
        \\ Try to present balance sheet items in a common-size format. To get an
        overview of the changes in the compoisition of assets over time.
    \item Capital Structure
        \\ Must be able to support management's strategic objectives as well as honor
        obligations in future.
        \\Some liabilities are more burdensome than others.
    \item Capitall Allocation Decision
        \be
            \item Financial stmts should be disaggreated by segment.
                \\- Business segment: $>$ 10\%of a large company
                \\- Geographic segement
            \item Compare methods
                \\- Compare EBIT margin to capital allocations, to see if
                the company invest on most profitable segment.
                \\- Compare cash flow generated by each segment with capital allocations
                . Cash flow $\approx$ EBIT + depreciation + amortization

\subsection{Analyze and interpret how balance sheet modifications, earnings normalization,
and cash flow statement related modifications affect a company's financial statements, financial ratios,
and overall financial condition}
\be
    \item Earnings quality and cash flow analysis
        \be
            \item Earnings quality: persistence and sustainability. Earnings closer
                to OCF are good. Check ratio of accruals to net operating assets to
                measure earnings quality. Split accruals and cash flow in earnings with balance method
                or cashflow stmt method.
            \item Accruals Ratio
                \\-Balance sheet method: 
                $$
                    Accruals = \Delta Asset - \Delta Liability - \Delta Cash=
                    NOA_{end}-NOA_{beg}
                $$
                where $NOA=Net operating asset = Asset - Liability - Cash$.
                $$
                    accrual ratio^{bs}=\frac{NOA_{end}-NOA_{beg}}{(NOA_{end}+NOA_{beg})/2}
                $$
                \\-Cash flow statement approach
                $$
                    Accruals = NI - CFO - CFI
                $$
                Higher ratio or wide fluctuated ratio are bad, indicating earnings manipulation.
                \\To compare these two measures.Eliminate cash paid for interest and taxes from OCF by adding them back. They 
                are not opearting income. -- CGO, cash generated from opeartions.

                    CGO = EBIT + non-cash charges - increase in working capital
                $$
                Compare CGO vs operating income to see if any problems.
            \item Market Value Decomposition
                \\ It's good to determine the standalone value of the parent company.

\subsection{Evaluate the quality of a company's financial data and recommend appropriate
adjustments to improve quality and comparability with similar companies, including adjustments
for differences in accounting standards, methods, and assumptions.}
\be
    \item Off-Balance-Sheet Financing
        \\Some important items are not reported on Blance sheet. Example: Opearting Leases.
        In analysis, an operating lease should be treated as a finance lease.
        \\Methods to convert operating lease:
        \\--Euqity is OK. Since assets and liabilities are increased by the same amount.
        \\--Income statement: replace the rental expense for the operating lease with 
        depreciation expense (on the lease asset) and interest expense(on the lease liability).

\section{Reading 21: Capital Budgeting}
\be
    \item Warm-up: Basics of Capital Budgeting
    \item Categories of Capital Budgeting Projects
        \\- Replacement project to maintain business
        \\- Replacement projects for cost reduction
        \\- Expansion projects
        \\- New product or market
        \\- Mandatory
        \\- Other projects
    \item Principles of Capital Budgeting
        \be
            \item Based on cash flows: 
                \\-Sunk cost: costs that cannot be avoided.
                \\Externalities: effects that the acceptance of a project
                may have on other cash flows
            \item Cash flows are based on opportunitiy costs.
                \\-OC: cash flow that the firm might lose by undertaking
                the project.
            \item The timing of cash flow is important.
            \item Cash flows are anayzed on an after-tax basis.
            \item Financing costs are reflected in the project's required rate 
                of return.
        \ee
    \item Modified Accelerated Cos Recovery System (MACRS)
        \be
            \item Definition: A depreciation method that most US companies used
                for tax purpose. Should use it as well in capital budgeting.
            \item You will have a MACRS table to compute incremental cash flows
            \item Half-year convention: asset is is in service in the middle of the
                first year. Therefore, 3-yr asset will have 4 calendar years.
            \item Depreciable basis: purchase price + any shipping or handling and
                installation costst.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the yearly cash flows of expansion and replacement
capital projects and evaluate how the choice of depreciation method affects those
cash flows}
\be
    \item Classification: 1, Initial investment outlay. 2, Operating cash flow over
        the project's life. 3, terminal-year cash flow
        \\- Initial investment outlay = FCInve + NWCInv = invest in Fixed capital
        + investment in net working capital.  NWCInv = $\Delta$non-cash current assets - $\Delta$non-debt current liabilties
            = $\Delta$NWC = changes in networking capital. Cash is not operating asset. If NWCInv is positive, cashflow will be negative. Cash
        is needed to invest in NWC.
        \\-  After-tax operating cash flows: CF = (S-C-D)(1-T)+D 
        = (Sales-Cash operating expense - Depreciation expense)(1-marginal tax rate)+D
        \\- Terminal year after-tax non-operating cash flows(TNOCF). Sometimes, NWCInv can be
        reverted at the terminal year.
    \item Expansion Project Analysis: increase both the size and earnings of a business.
        Using Initial investment outlay, After-tax ocf, and TNOCF to calculate NPV and IRR. Then 
        decide if we should accept the project.
    \item Other Presentatoin Formats.
        \\-Type: table format with cash flows collected by yr; tbl formate with cf collected by type.
    \item Replacement Project Analysis. Different from Expansion
        \\-Initial outlay, old asset will be sold: Outlay = FCInv+NWCInv-Sal$_0$+T(Sal$_0$-B$_0$)
        \\-Incremental operating CF, CF from new asset - CF from old asst: 
        $\Delta$CF=($\Delta$S-$\Delta$C)(1-T)+T$\Delta$D
        \\-TNOCF = (Sal$_TNew$-Sal$_TOld$)+NWCInv-T[(Sal$_TNew$-B$_TNew$)-(Sal$_TOld$-B$_Told$)]
\ee
\subsection{Expain how inflation affects capital budgeting analysis}
\be
    \item Analyzing nominal or real CF. Nominal CF has inflation, while real CF not. CF should be
        discounted at a correct rate. (Nominal rate or real rate.)
    \item Changes in inflation affect project profitability. Changes in inflation rate
        will change the value of future CF.
    \item Inflation reduces the tax savins from depreciation. Because the depreciation
        savings is less valuable, the tax paid is more.
    \item Inflation decreases the value of payments to bondholders.
    \item Inflation may affect revenues and costs differently.
\ee
\subsection{Evaluate cpaital projects and determine the optimal capital project in situation
of 1)Mutally exclusive projects with unequal lives, using either the least common multiple
of lives approach or the equivalent annual annuity approach, and 2) capital rationing.}
\be
    \item Mutually Exculive Projects with Different Lives
        \be
            \item Least Common multiple of lives approach. 
                \\ For example. a-3yr, b-6yr. We will use Cashflows for 2*a to compare
                with b-6yr.
            \item Equivalent annual annuity approach: Use FV=0 and current PV, to calculate
                the PMT.
        \ee
    \item Capital Rationing
        \\Firms will continue to invest in positive NPV until marginal return = marginal cost.
        \\If Firm doesn't have enough funds, it needs to allocate funds to maximize NPV.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation
can be used to asses the stand-alone risk of a capital project.}
Sensitivity analysis: change an input to see the changes in results.
\\Scenario analysis: A risk analysis technique that considers both the sensitivity of key output
variable to key input variables and the likely probability distributions of these variables. It studies
different possible scenarios, like {\it worst case, best case, base case.}
\subsection{Explain and calculate the discount rate, based on market risk methods, to use
in valuing a capital project}
\be
    \item CAPM: $R_{project}=R_F + \beta_{Project}[E(R_{MKT})-R_F]$
    \\ The calculated R is the appropriate discount rate. Also, it's the required return rate
    specific for one project.
    \item R=Hurdal rate
\ee
\subsection{Describe types of real options and evaluate a capital project using real
options}
\be
    \item Real options: allow managers to make future decisions that change the
        value of capital budgeting decisions made today.
    \item Types of real options:
        \\-Timing options: allow to delay aking an investment with the hope of having
        better information in the future.
        \\-Abandonment options: right to drop a project
        \\-Expansion options: right to make additional investments.
        \\-Fleibility options: 1. price-setting options: allow the company to change the price of
        of a product. 2. production-flexibility options: give some flexibilities in productions.
        \\-Fundamental options: projects that themselves are options. b/c the payoff
        depend on the price of an underlying asset.
    \item Evaluate project with real options. Approaches:
        \\1. Determine the NPV of the project w/t the option.
        \\2. Calculate the project NPV without the option and then add the 
        estimated value of the real option. 
        $$
            overall NPV = project NPV(based on DCF) - option cost + option value
        $$
        \\3. Use decision trees.
        \\4. Use option pricing models.
\ee
\subsection{Describe common capital budgeting pmistaks}
\be
    \item Failing to incorporte ecnomic response into the analysis. Example: 
        low barriers to entry will have more competitors.
    \item Misusing standardized templates.
    \item Pet projects of senior management. Projects backed by influential people
        are usually overrated.
    \item Basing investment decisions on EPS or ROE. Managers whose incentive is related
        related to ROE.
    \item Using the IRR criterion for project decision. NPV is good.
    \item Poor cash flow estimation.
    \item Misestimation of overheaded costs.
    \item Using the incorrect discount rate. Should use the rate for a specific project.
    \item Politics involved wity spending the entire capital budget. Spend entire budget
        and then ask for an increase for the next year.
    \item Failure to generate alternative investment ideas.
    \item Improper handling of sunk and opportunity costs. Shouldn't consider sunk costs
        in the evaluation of a project.
    \item 
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpreat accounting income and economic income in the 
context of capital budgeting.}
\be
    \item Economic income and Accounting income
        \\Economic income=cash flow + (ending market value - begin market value)
        =cash flow - economic depreciation. begining market value is PV of the remaining after-tax 
        cash flows.
        \\Accounting income=net income
    \item Difference
        \\ 1. Accounting depreciation is based on the original cost
        \\ 2. Financing costs are subtracted out to arrive at net income.
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among the economic profic, residual income, and claims valuation models
for capital budgeting and evaluate a capital project using each}
\be
    \item {\bf Economic profit:} EP=NOPAT - \$WACC=Net operating profit after tax
        -  WACC*capital. Capital = dollar amount of investment=equity + debt
        \\Returns on all supplies of income.
        \\Company value = NPV + initial capital investment
    \item MVA: market value added, is the NPV based on economic profit
        \\NPV=MVA=$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{EP_t}{(1+WACC)^t}$
    \item {\bf Residual income}: returns on equity
        \\Residual income = net income - equity charge
        \\$RI_t=NI_t-r_eB_{t-1}$. $r_e$: required return on equity.
        $B_{t-1}$: beginning of period book value of equity
        \\NPV =$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{RI_t}{1+r_e}^t$
        \\Company value = NPV + initial capital = NPV + inital euqity + debt
    \item {\bf Claims valuation approach}: Valuae debt and equity cash flows separately.
        \be
            \item Cash flows to debt holders: interest and principal payments, discounted at the cost of debt
            \item Cash flows to equity holders: dividends and share repurchases. rate at the cost of equity.
                \\ CF to equity = Operating income - principle payment to debt 
                = NI + depreciation - principal payments
            \item company value = market value of debt + mv of equity

\section{Reading 22: Captial Structure}
\subsection{Capital Structure Theory}
\subsection{Expalin the Modigliani-Miller propositions regarding capital structure,
including the effects of levergae, taxes, financial distress, agency costs, and
asymmetric information on a company's cost of equity, cost of capital, and optimal capital
structure}
\be
    \item MM Proposition I(No Taxes): The capital Structure Irrelevance Proposition
        \\Sum: MM proved that the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure
        under some restrictive assumptions.
        \\Assumptions:
        \\- Capital markets are perfectly competitve. No transactions costs, taxes,
        bankruptcy costs.
        \\- Investors have homogeneous expectations.
        \\- Riskless borrowing and lending: borrow at risk-free rate.
        \\- No agency costs: no conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.
        \\- Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions.
        \\Results: Value$_{leverge}$=Value$_{unleverage}$
    \item MM Proposition II(No Taxes): Cost of Equity and Leverage Proposition
        \\Sum: the cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion
        of debt financing.
        \\Result: 
        -Debtholders have a priority claim on assets and income, thus cost
        of debt $<$ cost of equity.
        -If the use of debt is increasing, the risk increase. Cost of equity is increasing.
        -No change in WACC
        -$r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)$; $r_e$ is the cost of CAPITAL. $r_0$ is unleveraged equity.
    \item MM Proposition I(With Taxes): Value is Maximized at 100\% Debt
        \\{\bf Tax shield provided by debt:} Firms like using debt because interest
        is tax-deductible.
        \\$V_L=V_U+(t\times d)$; Value of Leverage firm = Value of unxx firm + 
        tax rate times value of debt
        \\Value will be maximized if use 100\% debt.
    \item MM Proposition II(Wtih Taxes): WACC is Minimized at 100\% Debt
        \\$r_E=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_D)(1-T_c)$
    \item Costs and Their Potential Effect on the Capital Structure
        \be
            \item Costs of financial distress
                \\- Costs of finanical distress and bankrupty: direct(direct fees),
                indirect(lost some investment opportunities and trust from customers, suppliers, etc)
                \\- Probability of financial distress: Higer amounts of leverage result in 
                higher probabilty of distress.
                \\ Higher expected cost of fin. distress will discourage companies from debt.
            \item Agency costs of euqity: conflicts between interest between managers and shareholders.
                \\Net agency cost of euqity has 3 components
                \\- Monitoring costs: costs to supervise management
                \\- Bonding costs: assumed by manageent to assure shareholders that
                the managers are working in the shareholder's best interest.
                \\- Residual losses
            \item Costs of asymmetric information:
                \\ Resultig from the fact that managers have more infor than owners or creditors.
                \\ Shareholders creditors looking for the signals that tell what management have
                \\ - Taking on the commitment to make fixed insterest payments via debt financing
                is good. 
                \\ - Issuing equity is usually bad.
            \item Pecking order theory: signals management sends to investors via financing choices.
                \\ Managers will make financing choices that are least likely to send signal to
                investors.
                \\Choice: Internally generated equity(retained earnings) $>$ Debt $>$ External equity
                \\ Based on POT, the capital structure is the by product of the individual financing
                decision.
        \ee
    \item Static Trade-off Theory, include fin. distress:
        balance costs of fin. distress and tax shielding from debt
        \\$V_L=V_U + (t\times d)$-PV(costs of financial distress)
    \item Implications for Managerial Decison Making
        \\-MM's Propositions iwth no taxes: 1. capital structure is irrelevant with firm value. 
        2. WACC will not change. Increase use of debt will increase the cost of euqity.
        \\-MM"s Propositions with taxes: 100\% debt is good due to tax shielding.
        \\-Static trade-off theory
\ee
\subsection{Describe target capital structure and explian why a compny's actual captial
structure may flucturate around its target.}
\be
    \item Target capital structure: optiamal capital structure
    \item May flucturate
        \\- Management may choose to exploit opportunities in a specific financing source
        \\- Market value flucturation will occur, like changes in stock and bond markets.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the role of debt ratings in captial structure policy}
     Debt ratings: cost of capital is tied to debt ratings. Thus companies will keep the minimum
     ratings of debts.
\subsection{Explain factors an analysis should consider in evaluating the effect
of capital structure policy on valuation.}
Consider:
\be
    \item Changes in the company's capital structure over time
    \item Capital structure of competitiors with similar business risk
    \item Company-specific factors(like quality of corporate governance). Better 
        corporate governence will reduce agency costs.
\ee
\subsection{Describe internationa differences in the use of financial leverage, 
factors that expalin these differences and implications of these differences for investment analysis}
Capital structure of international firms will impact a firm's capital policy.
\be
    \item Total debt: Janpan, Italy, France will have more total debt in USA, UK.
    \item Debt Maturity: Co. in North Americal will use longer maturity debt than Co in Jp.
    \item Emerging market differences: Co. in developed companies will use more and longer debt
        than those in emerging markets.
\ee
Other factors are
\be
    \item Institutional and Legal factors
        \\- Strength of legal system: strong legal system results in less debt and long maturity
        in capital structure.
        \\- Information asymmetry: strong asymmetry \ra More debt. 
        \\- Taxes
    \item Financial Markets and Banking system factors
        \\- Liquidity of capital markets: larger and more liquid markets \ra longer maturity debt
        \\- Reliance on banking system: If more relian on banking systems, companies
        will be more leveraged.
        \\- Institutional investor presence: If instituional investors play more role,the
        capital structure may be changed.
    \item Macroeconomic factors
        \\- Inflation: higher inflation\ra use less debt and short maturity.
        \\- GDP growth: higher GDP growth\ra long maturity debt.

\section{Dividends and Share Repurchases: Analysiss}
\subsection{Compare theories of dividend policy and explain implications of each for share
value given a describption of a corporate dividend action}
\be
    \item {\bf Dividend irrelavance}:In a perfect world with no taxes, broker fees, and infinity
        divisiable shares, dividend policy has no effect on the price of a firm's
        stock or its cost of capital. Will not affect the required return on equity capital.
    \item {\bf Bird-in-hand argument for dividend policy}: Required return on equity capital
        $r_s$ decreases as the dividend payout increases.
    \item Tax aversion:Historically, higher tax on dividends than capital gain. Therefore, investors
        prefer to not receive dividends. While companies will make dividend payments necessary
        to avoid tax.
    \item Conclusion: 
\ee
\subsection{Describe types of information (signals) that dividend initiations, increases, 
decreases, and omissions may convey}
\be
    \item Dividend initiation: ambiuous. Positive: company is sharing its wealth; Negative: 
        a company has a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities.
    \item Unexpected dividend increase: Good.  Companies future is good.
    \item Unexpected dividend decreases or omissions: negative signals.
\ee 
\subsection{Expain how clientele effects and agency issues may affect a company's payout
policy.}
\be
    \item Clientele effect: dividend preferences of different groups are different.
        \\- Tax consideration. High tax-bracket investors(individuals) prefer low dividend
        payouts. Low-tax-bracket investors prefer high payouts.
        \\- Requirements of institutional investors: some of institu. investors
        will only invest companies that have dividend yield above some threshold.
        \\- Invdividual investor preferences.
    \item Agency issues
        \\- Between shareholders and managers: agency cost is due to difference interest
        between managers and stockholder. Manager may overinvest. Therefore, one way to reduce
        the agency cost is to increase the payout of free cash flow as dividends.
        \\- Between shareholders and bondholders: If high-risk debt outstanding, shareholders may pay
        themselves a large dividend.
\ee
\subsection{Explain factors that affect dividend policy.}
6 factors:
\be
    \item Investment opportunities. If the firm has many opportunities and need
        to react quickly, dividend payout would be low.
    \item Expected volatility of future earnings. If earnings are volatile, firms
        are more cautious in {\it changing} dividend payout.
    \item Financial flexibility.
    \item Tax considerations.
        \\- Dividend preference may different if capital gains and dividends are taxed
        at different rate.
        \\- Taxes on dividends are paid when dividend is received. Capital gain taxes
        are paid when shares are sold.
        \\- Tax-exempt institutions will be indifferent between dividends/capital gains.
    \item Flotation costs: 3\% to 7\% fee will be applied for new stocks, while retained
        earnings have no such fee. High flotation costs\ra lower dividend payout.
    \item Contractual and legal restrictions.
        \\- Impariment of capital rule: in some countries, dividend cannot be larger
        than retained earnings.
        \\- Debt covenants: many covnants require a firm to meet/exceed a certain target
        for liquidity rations and coverage ratios before they can pay a dividend.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the effective tax rate on a given currency unit of
corporate earnings under double taxation, dividend imputation, and split-rate tax systems.}
\be
    \item Double-taxation system
        \\ Earnings are taxed at corporate regardless of whether dividend. Dividend are taxed again
        for shareholders.
        \\ Effective rate = Corporate tax rate + (1-Corporate tax rate)(individual tax rate)(payout ratio)
    \item Imputation tax system
        \\ All taxes are effectively paid at the shareholder rate.
    \item Split-rate
        \\ Earnings that are distributed as dividends are taxed at a lower rate. Individual: dividends
        are taxed as income.
\ee
\subsection{Compare stable dividend, constant dividend payout ratio, and residual dividend
payout policies, and calculate the diviend under each policy.}
\be
    \item Stable Dividend Policy:
    \item Target Payout Ratio Adjustment Model
        \\ Expected dividend = previous dividend + (exp.d increase in EPS)(target payout ratio)(adjustment factor).
        Where adjustment factor = 1/number of years of which the adjustment will take place.
    \item Constant Dividend Payout Ratio Policy
        \\ Seldom used.
    \item Residual Dividend Model:
        \\ (Dividends) is based on (Earnings) less (funds retained to for the equity portion.) 
        \\ Advantages: 1. Simple to use; 2. Pursue investment opportunities without
        being constrained by dividend considerations.
        \\ Disadvantages: Dividends will be unstable.
    \item Long-term residual dividend model.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the choice between paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares}
Possible reasons to repurchase shares
\be
    \item Potential tax advantage
    \item Share price suport/signaling: company to show that they are confident with
        their stock.
    \item Added flexibility: repurchase can be a supplement to the dividend. Repurchase
        doesn't need long-term commitment.
    \item Offsetting dilution from employee stock options. 
    \item Increase financial leverage. If funded by new debt, share repurchase will 
        increase leverage. Besides, share repurchase may increase EPS, if the cost
        of fund $<$ EPS. 
\ee
\subsection{Describe broad trends in corporate dividend policies}
\be
    \item A lower proportion of US companies pay dividends compared to European ones.
    \item In developed markets, the proportion of companies paying cash dividends is down.
    \item The percentage making stock repurchases has been upwards.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret dividend coverage ratios based on 1) net income
and 2) free cash flow.}
\subsection{Identify characteristics of companies that may not be able to sustain
their cash dividend.}
{\bf Dividend safety:} the metric used to evaluate the probability of dividends
        continuing at the current rate for a company.
        \\-Useful ratios: Dividend payout ratio(dividens/net income) and 
        dividend coverage ratio(net income/dividends)
        \\Free cash flow to equity(FCEE): cash flow available for distribution
        to stockholders after working capital and fixed capital needs are accounted for.
        \\FCFE coverage ratio = FCFE/(dividends + share repurchase)


\section{Reading 24: Corporate Performance, Governance, and Business Ethics}
\subsection{Compare interest of key stakeholders gropus and explain the purpose of
a stakeholder impact analysis}
Stakeholders:
\be
    \item Definition: Groups with an interest or claim in a company.
    \item Key internal stakeholders
        \\-Stockholders
        \\-Employees

        \\-Uninons
        \\-Governments
        \\-Local communities
        \\-General public
\ee

Reconciling interests and the stakeholder analysis
\be
    \item Not all stakeholders are so interested in the profitability. e.g. Customers
        don't want to overpay. 
    \item Stakeholder Impact Analysis (SIA): Force the company to identify
        which stake groups are critical to the company.
    \item Stockholders are special stakeholders. Return on invested capital(ROIC)
        and growth in profits\ra Measure if the company satisfy shareholders
\ee

\subsection{Discuss problems that can arise in principal-agent relationships and
mechanism that may mitigate such problems.}
The Principal-Agent Relationship
\be
    \item Definition: PRA arises when one group delegats decision to another group.
    Problems: Information asymmetry. Agent doesn't tell everything to the principal.
    \item Example Problems
        \\ CEOs manipulate the board of directors to extract excessive compensation packages.
    \item Controlling PAR problems
        \\ Guide the behavior of agents
        \\ Reduce the asymmetry of information
        \\ Remove agents who misbehave and violate ethical principles.
    \item Ethics and Strategy, examples of unethical behavior

        \\Corruption
\ee
\subsection{Discuss roots of unethical behavior and how managers might ensure that ethical issues
are considered in business decision making}
Roots of Unethical Behavior
\be
    \item Personal ethics are flawed
    \item Failure to realize
    \item Culture to focus on profit/growth
    \item Flawed business culture where top management sets unrealistic goals
    \item Unethical leadership
\ee
\subsection{Compare the Friedman doctrine, Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics,
and Rights and Justicee Theories as approches to ethical decision making}
\be
    \item Friedman Doctrine: The only social responsibility is increase profits 
        ``within the rules of the game".
    \item Utilitarianism: seeks to produce the highest good for the largest number
        of people.
    \item Kantian Ethics: People are more than an economic input and desreve dignity
        and respect.
    \item Rights theories: all individuals have fundamental rights and privileges, and the
        utilitarianism's greatest good doesn't trmp these fundamental rights.
    \item Justice theories: justice is met if all participants would agree the rules
        are fair if the results is decided under 'veil of ignorance'.

\section{Reading 25: Corporate Governance}
\subsection{Describe objectives and core attributes of an effective corporate 
governance system and evaluate whether a company's corporate goverence has those
attributes}
\be

        \\CoI: crditors and suppliers; partners conflicts are addressed in contracts.
    \item Corporations
        \\Def: Distinct legal entities that have rights similar to those of an individual
        person.
        \\CoI: owners vs management
\ee
\subsection{Explain confilicts that arise in agency relationships, including
manager-shareholder conflicts and director-shareholder conflicts}
Principal-agent problem includes:
\be
    \item Managers and shareholders, examples
        \\Using funds to expand the size of the firm
        \\Get high salaries and perquisites
        \\Investing in risky ventures

    \item Directors and shareholders
        \\Lack of independene
        \\Board members have personal relationships with management

the board of directors and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of a company's corporate governance
practice}
The Board of Directors -- Standards related to the effectiveness
\\3/4 of board members should be indepedent.
\\Whether the board has an independent chairman: separate is good.
\\Qualifications of directors: should bring skills and experimence: for
board members to have the requisite industry, strategic planning, and risk management
knowledge, not serve on more than two or three boards.
\\How the board is elected: Annual elections are good
\\Board self-assessment practices
\\Frequency of separate sessions for independent directors: independent members
should meet at least annually, prefer quarterly.
\\Audit committee and audit oversight: audit comittee only has independent directors,
has expertise in financial/accounting, has full access to the cooperation management, and meets
with auditors at least annually.
\\Nominating committee: only have indepdent directors.
\\Compensation committee and the compensation awarded to management: should focus on 
long term goals. Shouldn't use the salary at other companies as a reference point. 
Good: have salaries as a small percentage of compensation, with bounus, options
and restricted stock for good performance.
\\Use of independent or expert legal counsel. Common practice: advise the board
of directors, but this is bad. Best: use independent, outside counsel whenever
legal counsel is required.
\\Statement of governance policies
\\Disclosure and transparency. Best: more disclosure is better. Should provide info
about organization structure, corporate strategy, insider transactions, compensation policies
and changes to governance structure.
\\Insider or related-party transations. Best: Any related-party transactions should be
proved by the board of directors.
\\Resonsiveness to shareholder proxy votes.  Should consider the shareholder's opinions.

\section{Mergers and Acquisitions}
\subsection{Classify merger and acquisition activities on forms of integration
and relatedness of business activities}
Forms of Integration
\be

    \item Subsidiary merger: the target company will be a sub of the purchaser.
    \item Consolidation: both companies will combine into a new company.
\ee
Types of Mergers
\be
    \item Horizontal merger: businesses in teh same or similar industries
    \item Vertical merger: the acquiring company seeks to move up/down the product
        supply chain.
    \item Conglomerate merger: two companies operate in completedly separate
        industries.
\ee
\subsection{Explain common motivations behind MA activity.}

    \item Achieving more rapid growth. 
    \item Increased market power.
    \item Gaining access to unique capabilities.
    \item Diversification: diversify the firm's cash flow. Merger are not likely to increse
        value purely for diversification reasons. B/c merger process involves a lot
        of costs.
    \item Bootstrapping EPS.

\subsection{Contrast merger transaction characteristics by form of acquisition,
method of payment, and attitude of target management}
Forms of Acquisition
\be
    \item Stock purchase: usually entire company.
        \\-Payment: directly to target company shareholders in exchange
        for their shares.
        \\-Approval: Majority shareholder approval required.
        \\-Corporate taxes: None.
        \\-Shareholder taxes: shareholders pay capital gains tax.
        \\-Liabilities Acquirer assumes liabilities of target.
    \item Asset purchase: usually part of a company
        \\-Payment: Made directly to target company.
        \\-Approval: No shareholder approval needed unless asset sale is substantial.
        \\-Corporate taxes: Target company pay capital gain tax.
        \\-Shareholder taxes: None.
        \\-Liabilities: Acquirer usually avoids assumptions of target's liabilities.
\ee
Method of Payment
\be
    \item Securities offering: pay with shares.
    \item Cash offers: pay with cash.
    \item Factors to choose securities/cashes
        \\-Distribution between risk and reward for the acquirer and target
        shareholders.
        \\-Relative valuations of companies involved. Stock offering is kind of
        a signal that acquirer's share may be overvalued.
        \\-Changes in capital structure.
\ee
Attitutde of Target management
\be
    \item Friendly merger offers process
        \\-both companies will negotiate, and draft a merger agreement, and 
        finally release all the information to the public.
    \item Hostile merger offers
        \\-Bear hug: Acquirer submits a merger proposal directly to the target's
        board of directors.
        \\-If bear hug fails, appeal directly to shareholders
        \\---Tender offer: buy the shares directly from shareholders
        \\---Proxy battle: have shareholders approve a new "acquirer approved" board
        of directors."
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among pre-offer and post-offer takeover defense mechanims}
Pre-offer and Post-offer. Pre-offer defense is better, b/c faces less scrutiny in court.
\\Pre-Offer Defense Mechanisms
\be
    \item Poison pill: give shareholder's right to buy shares at extremely
        attractive price
        \\- flip-in pill: target company's shareholders can buy target's share at a discount
        \\- flip-over pill: target shareholders can buy acquirer's shares at a discount
    \item Poison put: give bondholder's the option to get repayment immediately
    \item Restrictive takeover laws: some states in US will protect company 
        against a hostile takeover. Ohio/Pennsylvania
    \item Staggered board: Board of directors are split into 3 groups, each is 
        elected for a 3-year term. Prevent bidder controlling the board.
    \item Supermajority voting provision for mergers: require more support for 
        merger, like 66.7\%, 75\% or 80\%.
    \item Fair price amendment: restricts a merger offer unless a fair price is offered.
    \item Golden parachutes: give the managers a lot of money if they leave the company 
        after merger.
\ee
Post-Offer Defense Mechanisms
\be
    \item Just say no: target can tell shareholders merger is bad.
    \item Litigation: file a lawsuit against the acquirer that takes long time
        and a lot of money.
    \item Greenmail: payoff to the acquirer to terminate the merger.
    \item Share repurchases: target company submit a tender offer for its own shares.
        Acquirer therefore has to increase the bid price.
    \item Leveraged recapitalization: target assumes a lot of debt to repurchase
        shares. The capital structure will be unattractive.
    \item Crown jewel defense: target sell a essential subsidiary or major asset
        to a neutral theird party.
    \item Pac-Man defense: target can acuquire the aquirer.
    \item White knight defense: a white knight is a friendly third party. The friendly
        third party will start a bidding war against the acquirer.
    \item White squire defense: seek a third party to buy a minority stake
        of the company. However, the stake is big enough to block the merger.

\\Valuing a target company
\be
    \item Discounted cash flow analysis
    \item Comparable company analysis
    \item Comparable transaction analysis
\ee
\subsection{Calculate free cash flows for a target company, and estimate the
company's intrinsic value based on discount}
Dscounted Cash Flow(DCF) analysis: 1) Calculate future free cash flow.  
2) Calculated discounted cash.
\be
    \item Determine which free cash flow model to use for the analysis.
    \item Develop pro forma financial estimates.
    \item Calculate free cash flows using the pro forma data, starting with net income:
        \\
            \begin{tabular}{ll}
              & Net Income                                        \\
            + & Net interest after tax                            \\

            \end{tabular}
    \item Discounted free cash flows back to the present at the appropriate 
        discount rate. Usually use WACC, or WACC$_{adjusted}$ which includes the risk
        from the merger.
    \item Determine the terminal value and discount it back to the present.
        \\Method 1: assumes the company grows at a constant rate. 
        $$
            terminal value = \frac{FCF_T (1+g)}{WACC_{adjusted}}-g
        $$
        Method 2: $Terminal value_T=FCF_T\times (Projected price/FCF)$

\subsection{Estimat the value of a target company using comparable company
and comparable transaction analyses}
Comparable company analysis
\be
    \item Identify the set of comparable firms: same industry with similar size and capital structure.
    \item Calculate various relative value measures basaed on the current market price
        of companies in the sample with some useful quantities: 
        \\-Enterprise value(EV)=market value of debt and equity - the value of cash and investments.
        \\-Price to earnings P/E
        \\-Price to book P/B
        \\-Price to sales P/S
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics for the relatie value metrics and apply
        those measures to the target firm.
    \item Estimate a takeover premium:$TP=\frac{DP-SP}{SP}$, where TP: takeover premium,
        DP: deal price per share, SP: target company's stock price. The takeover
        premium is estimated by looking at recent takeovers on similar companies.
    \item Calculate the estimated takeover price for the target as the sum of
        estimated stock value based on comparable and the takeover premium.
\ee
Comparable transaction analysis: using recent takeover transactions of similar
companies to estimate the takeover price.
\be
    \item Identify a set of recent takeover transactions. Should be firms
        in the same industray and have a similar capital structure.
    \item Calculate various relative value measures baesd on \textbf{completed deal prices} for
        companies in the sample. 
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics for the relative value metrics and apply
        those measures to the target firm.
\ee
\subsection{Compare the discoutned cash flow, comparable company, and comparable transaction analyses 
for valuing a target company, including the advantages and disadvantages of each.}

\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-relatively eash to model
        \\-based on forecasts of conditions in the future
        \\-the model is easy to customize
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Hard to apply when free cash flows are negative
        \\-estimates of CF and earnings have error.
        \\-Discount rate changes over tive
        \\-Estimation error
\ee
Comparable company analysis: use market data from similar firms AND a takeover 
premium
\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-Data for comparable companies is easy to access
        \\-Assumptions that similar assets have similar value is good.
        \\-Estimates of value are from the market.
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Assumes that the market valuation of the comparable companies is accurate
        \\-Just get a fair stock price. Takeover premium must be determined.
        \\-Difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures
        in analysis.
        \\-Historical data for premiume estimate may not be timely.
\ee
Comparable transaction analysis: uses data from completed M\&A deals
\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-No need to estimate takeover premiums
        \\-Estimates of value from actuall M\&A deals
        \\-Reduce the risk that shareholders sue that the managers/BoD for 
        mispricing the deal. 
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Assumes that M\&A transactions are valued accurately.
        \\-Not enough transactions to use.
        \\-Difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changin capital structure.

\subsection{Evaluate a takeover bid, and calculate the estimated post-acquisition
value of an acquirer and the gains accrued to the target shareholders versus the
acquirer shareholders.}
\be
    \item Post-Merger Value of an Acquirer: $V_{AT}=V_{A}+V_T+S-C$, where 
        $V_{AT}$ is the post-merger value of the combined company, $V_A$, $V_T$ are
        acquirer and target, $S$ is synergies, and $C$ is the cash paid to target
        shareholders.
    \item Gain Accrued to the Target: $Gain_T=TP$=Takeover premium=$P_T-V_T$
    \item Cash payment VS Stock payment
        \\-Cash payment: price is just the cash
        \\-Stock payment: $P_T=N\times P_{AT}$=number of new shares$\times$price 
        per share of combined firm after the merger announcement.
\ee
Check the examples in notes. P306-Vol2
\subsection{Explain how price and payment method affect the distribution of risks and benefits 
in M\&A transactions}
\be
    \item Effect of price: acquirer hopes buy low, target hopes to sell high.
    \item Effect of Pyament Method
        \\-Cash offer: acquirers assumes the risk and the potential reward.
        \\-Stock offer: some of the risk and potential rewards frmo the
        merger shift to the target.
\ee
\subsection{Describe characteristics of M\&A transactions that creat value}
\be
    \item Short term: target's stock price gains \~30\%, and acquirer's lose 1\%~3\%
        \\-Winner's curse: the firm who wins will overpay the most
        \\-Managerial hubris: managers overestimate the synergies and expected benefits.
    \item Long term: Acquirers tend to underperform their peers
    \item mergers enhance value for the acquirer
        \\-Strong buyer: acquirers that have strong performance in the prior 3 yrs.
        \\-Low premium
        \\-Few bidders
        \\-Favorable market reaction
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among equity carve-outs, spin-offs, split-offs and liquidation}
    Diverstitures: a company selling, liquidating, spinning off a division  or subsidiary.
\be
    \item Equity carve-outs: create a new company. Shares are issued in public. 
    \item Spin-offs: create a new company. Shares are not issued to public but distributed
        to shareholders of parent company.
    \item Liquidations: break up the firm, and sell assets.
\ee
\subsection{Explain common reasons for restructuring}
\be
    \item Division no longer fits into management's long-term strategy.
    \item Lack of profitability
    \item Individual parts are worth more than the whole.

\be
    \item Sum-of-the-parts value: company operates mutiple divisions. Analyst value
        individual parts and add them.
    \item Conglomerate discount: investors apply a markdown to the value of a company that
        operates in many unrelated divisions.
        \\Reason
        \\-Internal capital inefficiency
        \\-Endogenous(internal) factors

\section{Reading 28: Return Concepts}
\subsection{Distinguish among realized holding period return, expected holding period return, required return
, return from convergence of price to intrinsic value, discount rate and internal rate
of return.}
\be
    \item Hoding Period Return: $r=\frac{P_1-P_0+CF_1}{P_0}=\frac{P_1+CF_1}{P_0}-1$
    If the CF is received before the end of the period, CF$_1$=the cash flow received
    and the interest earned.
    \\Holding period return is annualized.
    \item Realized and Expected Holding Period Return
        \\Realized return: historical return based on past prices/Cf
        \\Expected return: forecast
    \item Required return: minimum return an investor requires given the asset's risk. 
        \\Also called Opportunity cost.
        \\ Expected return greater(less) than required return\ra Undervalued(Overvalued)
    \item Price Convergence: Expected return = required return + $\frac{V_0-P_0}{P_0}$
    \item Discount Rate: 
    \item Internal Rate of Return: Rate that makes PV of CF = The current price of securities
        \\In efficient market, IRR=required return
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret an equity risk premium using historical and forward-looking
estimation approaches}
Background:
\be
    \item Equity risk premium: The return in excess of risk-free rate = required return on equity
    index - risk-free rate
    \item Required return for individual stocks = rfr+$\beta_j\times$ (equity risk premium)
\ee
Estimates of The Equity Risk Premium:
\be
    \item Historical Estimates: use mean market return and mean rfr
        \\-Strength: Objectivity, simplicity, unbiase`d
        \\-Weakeness: i) Assume mean/variable constant over time. ii) Biased by survivorship
    \item Forward-Looking Estimates: use current informatin and expectations on
        economic/financial variables.
        \\-Strength: doesn't rely on stationary assumption; less influenced by
        survivorship.
        \\-Three model: Gordon growth, supply-side, estimate from survays
\ee

Three main
\be
    \item Gordon Growth Model=constant growth model
        \\GGM equity risk premium = (1-year forecasted dividend yield on mkt index)
        + (consensus long-term earnings growth rate) - (long-term government bond yield))
        =$D_1/P + \hat{g}-r_{LT,0}$
        \\-Weakness:i) this estimation will change over time. ii)Assume stable growth rate
    \item Supply-Side Estimates(Marcoeconomic Models): based on relations between
        macroeconomic variabls and financial variables.
        \\-Strength: proven models and current information
        \\-Weakness: only good for developed countries
        \\-Model: ERP=$[1+\hat{i}]\times[1+\hat{rEg}\times[1+\hat{PEg}]]-1+\hat{Y}
        -\hat{RF}$
        \\where $\hat{i}$=expectaion inflation, $\hat{rEg}$=expected real growth in EPS,
        $\hat{PEg}$=expected changes in the P/E ratio, $\hat{Y}$=the expected yield on the index,
        $\hat{RF}$
    \item Survey Estimates: easy to obtain, but may has a wide disparity.
\ee
\subsection{Estimate the required return on an equity investment using the capital asset
pricing model, the Fama-French model, the Pator-Stambaugh model, macro-economic multifactor models,
and the build-up method.}
\be
    \item Capital Asset Pricing Model
        \\Required return on stock j = risk-free rate + equity risk premium $\times$ beta of j
    \item Multifactor models
        \\Required return = RF + risk premium$_1$ + risk premium$_2$ + ... + risk premium$_n$
        \\risk premium$_i$=factor sensitivity$\times$ factor risk premium
    \item Fama-French Model: accounts for the higher returns associated with small-cap stocks
        \\required return of stock j=RF + $\beta_{mkt,j}\times(R_{mkt}-RF)+
        \beta_{SMB,j}\times(R_{small}-R_{big})+\beta_{HML,j}\times(R_{HBM}-R_{LBM})$
        \\ $(R_mkt-RF)$ = return on a value-weighted market index - risk free rate; 
        \\$R_{small}-R_{big}$ = a small-cap return premium equal to the average
        return on small-cap portfolis - the average return on large-cap portfolios;
        \\ $R_{HBM}-R_{LBM}$=a value return premium equal to the average return on high-book-to-market
        portolios - the average return on low-book-to-market portfolios
        \\Expected value for $\beta_{mkt,j}=1$, latter two $\beta$ are 0
    \item Pastor-Stambaugh Model: adds a liquidity factor to the F-F model.
        base: 0; less liquid: positive $\beta$
    \item Macroeconomic Multifactor Models: use multiple factors and correspoding beta. Burmeister, Roll, and Ross Model:
        \\-Confidence risk
        \\-Time horizon risk
        \\-Inflation risk
        \\-Business cycle risk
        \\-Market timing risk
        \\Add RF and beta times these risks.
    \item Build-up method: good for a company where betas are not readily obtainable
        \\Required return = RF + equity risk premium + size premium + specific-company premium
    \item Bond-Yield Plus Risk Premium Method: good for a company with publicly traded debt
        \\Risk Premium = Risk premium + the YTM of Long-term debt
\ee
\subsection{Explain beta estimation for public companies for public companies, thinly
traded public companies, and nonpublic companies}
\be
    \item Beta Estimates for Public Companies
        \\-Public company: compute by regressing the returns of stock on the returns
        of the overall mkt.
        \\-Common Index: SP500, NYSE; Common time scale: 5 years of monthly or 2 years of weekly data.
    \item Adjusted Beta for Public Companies
        \\-beta drift: tendency of an estimated beta to revert to 1.0 over time
        \\-Blume method: adjusted beta = (2/3 regression beta) + (1/3$\times$1.0)
    \item Best Estimates for Thinly Traded stocks and Nonpublic Companes
        \\Steps
        \\-Find a benchmark company XYZ, publicly traded and similar
        \\-Estimate the benchmark beta
        \\-Find Unlevered beta: unlevered beta for XYZ = (beta of XYZ) $1/(1+debt of XYP/equity of XYZ)$
        \\-Estimated beat for ABC = unlevered beta of XYZ $\times (1+debt of ABC/equity of ABC)$

        \\W: use historical values that may or may not be relevant to current market conditions
\ee
\subsection{Explain international considerations in required return estimation}
Need to consider the exchange risk. Two models
\be
    \item Country Spread Model: Use a developed market as benchmark and add a risk premium
        (difference between the yield on bonds)
    \item Country Risk Rating Model: Use a model, and take the risk rating as 
        independent variable.

    \item Selling General and Administrative Costs(SG\&A)
        \\-SGA operating expenses are less sensitive to changes in sales.
        \\-SGA selling and distribution costs are more directly related to sales volumes.
    \item Financing Cost: interest for debt/equity financing
        \\-Net Debt: gross debt - cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities
        \\-Net interest expense: gross interest expense - interest income on cash/short-term debt

        and required rate of return.
    \item Discounted cash flow to estimate the terminal value:
        \\-Cash flows: using a mid-cycle value
        \\-Expected growth rate
    \item IMPORTANT: find inflection points, from when the future will not be like
        the past

\section{Reading 30:Discounted Dividend Valuation}
\subsection{Compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs
to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which
each measure is suitable}
Dividend discount models:
\be
    \item Definition: DDM define cash flow as the dividends to be received by the
        shareholders.
    \item Advantages and dis
        \\-A: theoretically justified; dividends are less volatile than other measures
        \\-DA: hard for firms that don't pay dividends; dividend policy may be controled by someone,
        therefore doesn't show the expected cash flow to share holders
    \item Appropriate for
        \\-Companies that have a history of dividend payments
        \\-Dividend policy is clear and related to the earnings of the firm
        \\-when The valuation Perspective is that of a minority shareholder
\ee
Free cash flow to the firm(FCFF):
\be
    \item Definition: Cash flow generated by the firm's operations that in excess
        of the capital investment required to sustain the firm's current productive
        capacity. 
    \item Free cash flow to equity: cash available to stockholders after funding captial and
    and expenses related with debt financing
    \item Adavantage and disadvantage
        \\-A: good for many firms
        \\-Dis: i) Company may have negative CF for many years.
    \item Appropriate for
        \\-Firms do not have dividend payment history or payment history is not related
        to earnings
        \\-firms which CF corresponds to earnings
        \\-when valuation perspective is of a controlling shareholder.
\ee
Residual income
\be
    \item Definition: RI - earnings that exceeds the investor's required return. 
    \item Advantage and dis
        \\-A: good for companies with negative cf and to divident-and non-dividend-paying
        firms
        \\-Dis: require in-depth analysis on accountings. 
    \item Appropriate:
        \\- firms that do not have dividend histories
        \\- negative free cf
        \\- firms with transparent financial reporting
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the value of a common stock using the dividend
discount model for single and multiple holding periods}
\be
    \item One-Period DDM: $V_0=\frac{D_1+P_1}{1+r}$
        \\D$_1$: dividends to be received at end of year 1
        \\P$_1$: price expeted upon sale at end of year 1
        \\-required return
    \item Two-Period DDM: $V_0=\frac{D_1}{(1+r)^1}+\frac{D_2+P_2}{(1+r)^2}$
    \item Multi-Period DDM: $V_0=\frac{D_1}{(1+r)^1}+\frac{D_2}{(1+r)^2}+...+\frac{D_n+P_n}{(1+r)^n}$
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the value of a common stock using the Gordon growth model and
explain the model's underlying assumptinos}
\be
    \item Assumptions: dividends increase at a constant rate
        \\-Firm expects to pay a dividend,$D_1$, in one year
        \\-Dividends grow in a costant rate $g$
        \\-the growth rate $g$ is less than the required return $r$
    \item Formula:
        $V_0=\frac{D_0(1+g)^1}{1+r}+...+\frac{D_0(1+g)^n}{(1+r)^n}=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}
        =\frac{D_1}{r-g}$
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the implied growth rate of dividends using
the Gordon growth model and current stock price}
Gordon $V_0=\frac{D_1}{r-g}$. Know 3 of them, we can find the last one.
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the present value of growth opportunities
(PVGO) and the component of the leading price-to-earnings ratio(P/E) related to PVGO}
$V_0=\frac{E_1}{r}+PVGO$
where
\\E$_1$=earnings at t=1
\\r=required return on equity
If the company has additional opportunities, it will be great.
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the justified leading and trailing P/Es using the Gordon
growth model}
\be
    \item Leading P/E = $\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{D_1/E_1}{r-g}=\frac{1-b}{r-g}$
        \\Trailing P/E = $\frac{P_0}{E_0}=\frac{D_0\times(1+g)/E_0}{r-g}=\frac{(1-b)\times(1+g)}{r-g}$

\ee
\subsection{Calculate the value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred
stock}
\be
    \item Value of perpetual preferred shares = $\frac{D_P}{r_p}$, where $D_P$
        is preferred dividend, and $r_p$=cost of preferred equity.
\ee
\subsection{Describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and
justify its selection to value a company's common shares}
\be
    \item Strength:
        \\-good for stable, mature, dividend-paying firms
        \\-good for valuing market indices
        \\-easily communicated and explaind
        \\-Can be used to determin price-implied growth rates, required rates
        of return and value of growth opportunities
    \item Limitations
        \\-Valuations are sensitive to growth rates and required returns
        \\-not good for non-dividend-paying stocks
        \\-unpredictable growth patterns of some firms will be bad for the company
\ee
\subsection{Explain the assumptions and justify the selection of the two-stage DDM,
the H-model, the three-stage DDM, or spreadsheet modeling to value a company's common
shares}
\be
    \item Two stage DDM:
    \\the company grows at a high rate for a short time, then back to a long-run
        perpetual growth rate. ie. Dividend growth rates will change.
    \item H-Model:
        \\ The growth rate will declines linearly over the high-grwoth stage
        until it reaches the long-run average growth rate.
    \item Three-stage DDM: good for firms that have three distinct stages of earnings growth.
    \item Spreadsheet modeling: in practice, use spreadsheets to model any pattern of dividend
        growth every year.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the growth phase, transitional phase, and matruity phase of a business}
\be
    \item Initial growth phase: rapidly increasing earnings, little or no dividends, and heavy reinvestment
    \item Transition phase: earnings and dividends are increasing but still low
    \item Maturity phase: earnings growth at a stable but slower rate, payout ratios
        are stable, ROE=required rate of return
\ee
\subsection{Describe terminal value and explain alternative approaches to determining
the terminal value in a DDM}
Ways to determin the terminal value:
\be
    \item Gordon growth model: at some point of futre, assume dividends will begin
        to grow at a constant.
    \item Market price multiples: estimate market price multiples, and using it to
        estimate future price.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the value of common shares using the two-stage of DDM, 
the H-model, and the three-stage DDM.}
\be
    \item Valuation Using the Two-Stage Model: 
        $$
        V_0=\sum_{t=1}^n\frac{D_0(1+g_s)^t}{(1+r)^t}+ \frac{D_0(1+g_s)^n(1+g_L)}{(1+r)^n(r-g_L)}
        $$
    \item Valuation using the H-Model
        $$
        V_0=\frac{D_0(1+g_L)}{r-g_L}+\frac{D_0\times H\times(g_s-g_L)}{r-g_L}
        $$
        \\Where $H=t/2=$half-life (in years) of high-growth period
    \item Valuation using the Three-stage DDM
        \\Similar to two-stage DDM
\ee
\subsection{Estimate a required return based on any DDM, including the Gordon growth model and the H-model}
LOS doesn't need you to calculate the required return.
\be
    \item From Gordon growth model: $r=\frac{D_1}{P_0}+g$
    \item From H-Model: $r=\frac{D_0}{P_0}((1+g_L)+H(g_s-g_L))+g_L$

\subsection{Explain the use of spreadsheet modeling to forecsh dividends
and to value common shares}
Need to estimate the terminal value of a security. Then discount it back to current days.
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the sustainable growth rate of a compnay and demonstrate the
use of DuPont analysis to estimate a company's sustainable growth rate.}
SGR: the rate at which earnings and dividends can continue to grow indefinitely
\\SGR=b$\times$ROE
$$
    ROE=\frac{net income}{stockholder's equity}=\frac{net income}{sales}
    \frac{sales}{total assets}\times\frac{total assets}{stockholder's equity}
$$
PRAT Model: Profit margin, Retention rate, Asset turnover, and financial leverage
$$
    SGR=b\times ROE=\frac{Net income-dividends}{net income}\frac{net income}{sales}
    \frac{sales}{total assets}\times\frac{total assets}{stockholder's equity}
$$
\subsection{Evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the
market based on a DDM estimate of value.}
If market price higher than the DDM price, then it's overvalued. 

\section{Reading 31: Free Cash Flow Valuation}
Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow removes cash to pay operation expense, working capital
investment, and fixed capital investment.\\
FCFF: cash available to stockholder's and bondholders.
\subsection{Compare the FCFF and FCFE approaches to valuation.}
\be
    \item Firm value = FCFF discounted at WACC
    \item Equity value = FCFE discounted at required return on equity
    \item Equity value = Firm value - Market value of debt
\ee
Difference between FCFF and FCFE:
\be
    \item FCFE is easier and straightforard
    \item FCFF is good if the firm has significant debt outstanding.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach}
Ownership perspective
\be
    \item Free cash flow approach
        \be
        \item Control perspective: for an acquirer, who can change the firm's dividend policy
        \item For minority shareholders perspective
        \ee
    \item Dividend approach
        \\ Perspective: minority owner. They have no direct control over the firm's dividend
        policy.
\ee
Why prefer Free Cash Flow than dividend-based valuation?
\be
    \item Companies pay no/low cash dividends.
    \item Dividends are decided by the board of directors. Not align with the firm's long-run profitability.
    \item Free Cash Flow are better if the company is an acquisition target. B/c new owners
        might change the distribution of dividends.
    \item FCF is more related to long-run profitability.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, EBIT, EBITDA, CFO to calculate
FCFF and FCFE}
Terms:
\be
    \item EBIT: Earnings before inteerest and taxes
    \item EBITDA: Earnigns before interest, taxes, depreciations, and amortization
    \item CFO: Cash flow from operations
\ee
Calculating FCFF from net income: 
\\FCFF = NI + NCC + Int$\times$(1-tax rate)-FCInv-WCInv
\be
    \item NCC(non cash charges): like amortization of intangible assets, amortization of a bond discount, 
        deferred taxes.
    \item Fixed capital investment: they do not appear on the income statement, but they represent
        cash leaving the firm.
        \\FCInv = Capital expenditures - proceeds from sales of long-term assets
        \be
            \item If no long-term assets were sold:FCInv = ending net PP\&E - beginning PP\&E + depreciation
            \item If long-term assets sold: FCInv = ending net PP\&E - beginning PP\&E + depreciation - Gain on sale.
        \ee
        \be
            \item Working capital investment: Change in working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, notes payble, 
                and the current portion of long-term debt
            \item Interest expense: should add it back.
        \ee
\ee
Other Formulas:
\be
    \item Calculating FCFF from EBIT:
    \\FCFF=EBIT$\times$(1-tax rate)+Depreciation - FCInv - WCInv
    \item Calculating FCFF from EBITDA
        \\FCFF=EBITDA$\times$(1-tax rate) + Dep$\times$tax rate - FCInv - WCInv
    \item Calculating FCFF from CFO
        \\FCFF=CFO+Int$\times$(1-tax rate)-FCInv
    \item Calculating FCFE from FCFF:
        \\FCFE=FCFF-Int$\times$(1-tax rate)+net borrowing
    \item Calculating FCFE from net income
        \\FCFE=NI+NCC-FCInv-WCInv+Net borrowing
    \item Calculate FCFE from CFO:
        \\FCFE=CFO-FCInv+Net borrowing
\ee
Free Cash flow with Preferred stock
\be
\item FCFF/FCFE above assume that the company only have debt and common equity.
Preferred stock dividends should be added back to get FCFF. PS can be considered as
debt, but dividends are not tax deductible.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate FCFF and FCFE}
\be
    \item FCFF = Changes in cash balance + Net payments to debt providers
        + Net payments to equity stakeholders
    \item FCFE = Changes in cash balances + Net payments to equity stakehoders
\ee
\subsection{Describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE}
Two approaches
\be
    \item Historical Free Cash Flow:
        \\-Assumptions: constant growth, constant fundamental factors
    \item Components of free cash flow
        \\-Assumptions: each component grow at different rate; ties sales forecasts
        to future captial expenditures, depreciation expenses, and changes in working
        capital
        \\-IMPORTANT: Capital expenditures\ra i) Outlays that are needed to
        maintain existing capacity: current levels of sales; ii) Outlays that are
        needed to support growth: predicted sales growth.
\ee 
Forecasting FCFE with the second method, Target debt-to-asset ratio for the new
investment is fixed in Fixed Capital and Working Capital
\\FCFE=NI-(1-DFR)$\times$(FCInv-Dep)-(1-DR)$\times$WCInv
\subsection{Compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models}
The FCFE: control perspective\\
Dividend discount: Minority perspective
\subsection{Explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes
in leverge may affect future FCFF and FCFE}
dividends, share repurchases, share issues have no effect on FCFF and FCFE
\\Changes in leverge have no effects on FCFF and minor effects on FCFE.
\subsection{Evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation}
Net income: Poor for FCFE
\\FCFE=NI+NCC-FCInv-WCInv+net borrowing
\\EBITDA: poor for FCFF
\\FCFF=EBITDA$\times$(1-tax rate)+Dep$\times$tax rate-FCInv-WCInv
\subsection{Explain the single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage FCFF nd FCFE models
and select and justify the appropriate model given a company's characteristics}
Single-Stage FCFF Model
\be
    \item Assumptions: i)FCFF grows$@$constant g. ii)growth rate$<$WACC
    \item Eqution: Value of the firm = $\frac{FCFF_1}{WACC-g}$=
        $\frac{FCFF_0\times (1+g)}{WACC-g}$
\ee
Single-stage FCFE Model
\be
    \item Assumptions: Similar to FCFF
    \item Value of the equity = $\frac{FCFE_1}{r-g}$=
        $\frac{FCFE_0\times (1+g)}{r-g}$
    \item Often used in international valuation
\ee
Multistage Models: How Many Variations are there?
\be
    \item key: Value = PV of expected future CF discounted at the appropriate discount rate
    \item Comparisons
        \\-FCFF VS FCFE: FCFF - WACC, FCFE - required return on equity
        \\-Two stage vs three stage: just different time scale
        \\-Forecasting growth in total free cash flow (FCFF or FCFE) VS forecasting
        the growth rates in the components of free cash flow: These two models are good.
\ee
Model Assumptions and Firm Characteristics
\be
    \item Two- or three stage? two stage: short-term supernormal growth; three-stage: like
        growth phase, mature phase, and a transistion phase
\ee
\subsection{Estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow models}
Examples on Vol 3 P137
\subsection{Explain the use of lsensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE Valuations}
\be
    \item Sensitivity analysis: how sensitive an analyst's valulation results are to changes
        in each of a model's inputs
    \item Two majors sources
        \\- Estimate the future growth in FCFF and FCFE, growth forecasts depend on a firm's
        future profitability.
        \\- The chosen base years for FCFF or FCFE growth forecasts
\ee
\subsection{Describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in multistage valuation model}
Two way
\be
    \item Use single-stage model, assume that the forecasted FCFF and FCFE will grow at
        the long-term stable growth rate after some time
    \item Use multiples: 
        \\- Terminal value in year n = trailing P/E$\times$ earnings in year n
        \\- Terminal value in year n = leading P/E$\times$ earnings in year n+1
\ee


\section{Market-Based Valutation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples}
\subsection{Distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on
forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation, and
explain economic rationales for each approach.}
\be
    \item Method of comparables: values a stock based on the average price multiple
        of the stock of similar companies
        \\- Law of One Price
    \item Method of forecasted fundamentals: values a stock based on the ratio of
        its value from a discounted cash flow model to some fundamental variables.
        \\- Value = PV of all future cash flows
\ee 
\subsection{Calculate and interpret a justified price multiple}
\subsection{Describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples
and dividend yield in valuation}
\subsection{Calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield}
Justified price multiple: The multiple when the stock is fairly valued.
\\P/E Ratio: price to earnings
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\A: popular used, P/E differences different significantly related to long-run average
        \\DisA: Earnings can $<$0, Earnings can be volatile, earnings can be distored in reports.
    \item Equation:
        \\Trailing P/E = Mkt Price per Share/EPS over previous 12 monthes. 
        \\Leading P/E = Mkt Price per Share/EPS expected over next 12 months
\ee
P/B Ratio: price to book value
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\A: Book value usually$>$0; Bv mare stable than EPS; Good for firms
        that hold liquid assets; good for firms that are expected to go out of business;
        good to explain differences in long-run average stock returns
        \\DisA: exclude intangible economic assets; misleading; accounting conventions may
        different; inflation/techo change will change the book value/mkt values of assets
    \item P/B ratio = Mkt value of equity/book value of equity = Mkt price pshare/BValue pshare
        \\Book value of equity = Common shareholder's equity = Total Assets - total liabilities - Preferred stock
\ee
P/S Ratio: price to sale
\be
    \item A and DisA
        \\A: always positive; hard to manipulate sales; not volatile; good for
        mature/cyclical industries or start-up
        \\DisA: high growth in sales$\neq$high profit; P/S ratio doesn't describe
        cost structures; revenue recognization may be distorted.
    \item P/S ratio= Mkt value of equity/total sales 
\ee
P/CF ratio: price to cash flow
\be
    \item A: CF is hard to manipulate; P/CF more stable than P/E
    \item Dis: If we use CF=Eps + noncash charges, noncash revenue and net changes
        in working capital are ignored, though they will affect actual cash flow;
        FCFE is preferable to operating CF, however, FCFE is more volatile.
\ee
Dividend Yield: common dividend to the market price
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\-A: dividend yield contributes to total investment return; dividends are not as risky as the 
        capital appreciation component of total return
        \\-DisA: DY doesn't include capital appreciation;
    \item Equation
        \\ Trailing D/P = 4$\times$ most recent quarterly dividend/mkt price ps
        \\ Leading D/P = forecasted dividends over next four quarters / mkt ps
