\section{Reading 9: Correlation and Regressions}
\subsection{Sample covar and sample correlation coefficients}
Sample covariance: $cov_{x,y}=\sum_i \frac{(X_i-\bar X)(Y_i-\bar Y)}{n-1}$
\\Sample correlation coeff: 
$r_{x,y}=\frac{cov_{x,y}}{s_x s_y}$, where $s_x$ is the sample dev of X.
\subsection{Limtations to correlations analysis}
Outliers: The results will be affected by extreme data points.(outliers)\\
Spurious correlation: There might be some non-zero corrlation coeff, but 
acutally they have no correlation at all.\\
Nonlinear relationships: Correlation only describe the linear relastions.
\subsection{Hypothesis: determine if the population 
correlation coefficient is zero}
Two-tailed hypothesis test:
$$
H_0: \rho=0, H_a: \rho \neq 0
$$
Assume that the two populations are {\bf normally} distrubited, then we 
can use t-test:
$$
t=\frac{r\sqrt{n-2}}{1-r^2}
$$:
Reject $H_0$ if  $t>+t_{critical}$ or $t<-t_{critical}$. Here,$r$ is the
sample correlation. Remember, you need to check t-table to find the t-value.
\subsection{Determine dependent/indepedent variables in a linear regression}
{\bf Simple linear regression}: Explain the variation in a dependent variable 
in terms of the variabltion in a single indepedent variable.
{\bf Independent variables} are called explanatory variable, the exogenous 
variable, or the predicting variable. 
{\bf Dependent variable} is also called the explained variable, the endogenous 
variable, or the predicted variable.
\subsection{Assumptions in linear regression and interpret regression coeff.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assumptions of linear regression:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Linear relationship must exist.
            \item The indepedent variable is uncorrelated with residuals.
            \item Expected Residual term is value. $E(\epsilon)=0$
            \item variance of the residual term is const. $E(\epsilon_i^2)=
                \sigma_\epsilon^2$. Otherwise, it will be "heteroskedastic"
            \item The residual term is independently distributed. otherwise -- "auto correlation"" 
                $E(\epsilon_i\epsilon_j)=1$    
            \item The residual term is normally distributed.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Simple Linear Regression Model
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Model: $Y_i=b_0+b_1X_i+\epsilon_i$, where $i=1...n$, and $Y_i$ is 
     the actual observed data.
            \item The fitted line, the line of best fit
                : $\hat{Y}=\hat{b_0}+\hat{b1}X_i$. Where $\hat{b_0}$
                is the estimated parameter of the model.
            \item How to choose the best fitted line? {\bf Sum of squared errors}
                 is minimum.
                 $$
                    \hat{b_1} = \frac{cov_{x,y}}{sigma_x^2}
                 $$
                 where $X$ is the indepdent variable. $\hat{b_1}$ is 
                 "regression coeffcient".
                 $$
                    \hat{b_0} = \bar Y - \hat{b_1}\bar X
                 $$
                 where $\bar X, \bar Y$ are the mean.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Interpreting a regression coefficient: Similar to basic ideas of 
        "slope". Keep in mind: any conclusion regarding this parameter needs 
        the statistical significance of the slope coefficient.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Standard error of estimate, the coeff. of determination and a 
confidence interval for a regression coefficient.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Standard error of estimate (SEE): Standard deviation between $Y_{estimate}$
        and $Y_{actual}$. - Smaller: better
    \item Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)
        The percentage of the total variance in the dependent variable that is 
        predictable from the indepedent variable. - One indepdent variable: $R^2=r^2$,
        where $r^2$ is the square of correlation coefficient.
    \item Regression Coefficient confidence interval
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hypothesis: $H_0: b_1=0 \Leftrightarrow H_a: b_1\neq 0$ 
            \item Confidence interval:
                $\hat{b_1}-(t_c s_{\hat{b_1}})<b_1<\hat{b_1}+(t_c s_{\hat{b_1}})$ 
            $s_{\hat{b}_1}$ is the standard error of the regression coeffi.  
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hypothesis: Determine if $\hat{b}_1=b_1$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item t-test statistic: $t_{b_1}=\frac{\hat{b}_1 - b_1}{s_{\hat{b}_1}}$
    \item Reject: if $t>+t_{critical}$ or $t<-t_{critical}$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate the predicted value for the depedent variable}
If an estimated regression model is known, $\hat{Y}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 X_p$
\subsection{Calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the predicted 
value of the depedent variable}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Eq: $\hat{Y}\pm(t_c s_f)$, where $s_f$ is the {\color{red}std error of the forecast.}
    \item $s_f^2=SEE^2 \left[1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(X-\bar X)^2}{(n-1)s_x^2} \right]$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $SEE^2=$ variance of the residuals
            \item $s_x^2=$ variance of the indepdent variable
            \item $X =$ value of the independent variable where the forecast was
                made.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{ANOVA in regression. Interpret results, and calculate F-statistic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the total variability 
        of the depedent variable. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Total sum of squares(SST): $SST=\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar Y)^2$
                \\SST is the total variation in the depedent variable.
                $Variance=SST/(n-1)$
            \item Regression sum of squares(RSS): $RSS=\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{Y}_i-\bar Y)^2$
                \\RSS is the explained variation.
            \item Sum of squared errors(SSE): $SSE=\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)^2$
                \\SSE is the unexplained variation.
            \item {\color{red}$SST = RSS+SSE$ I cannot get this equation yet}
                You need to know how to use these squares.
            \item Degree of freedom: i) Regression(Explained): $k=1$, since we only
                estimate one parameters.
                ii) Error(Unexplained) $df=n-k-1=n-2$
                iii) Total variation $df=n-1$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Calculating $R^2$ and {\bf SEE}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $R^2=explained variation/total varn=RSS/SST$
            \item $\bf{SEE}=\sqrt\frac{SSE}{n-2}$ {\bf SEE} is the std deviation of the
                regression error terms.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item The F-Statistic: used to explain whether {\it at least one} indepdent parameter
        can significanly explain the dependent parameter.  
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item F-statistic eq: $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}=\frac{RSS/k}{SSE/n-k-1}$
                 where $MSR=$ mean regression sum of squares.
                       $MSE=$ mean squared errors. 
                       Note: \color{red}{One tailed test!}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item F-statistic with one independent variable.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hypothesis: $H_0: b1=0 \Leftrightarrow H_a: b1\ne 0$
            \item degree of freedom: $df_{rss}=k=1,df_{sse}=n-k-1$
            \item Decision rule: reject $H_0$ if $F>F_c$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations of regression analysis}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parameter instability: the estimation eq may not be useful for other times.
        \item Limited usefulness: other participants may also use the same eq.
        \item Assumptions does not hold: i) Heteroskedastic, i.e., non-const
            variance of the error terms. ii) autocorrelation, i.e., error terms
            are not independent.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Reading 10: Multiple Regression and Issues in Regression Analysis}
Some basic ides
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Model: 
            $Y_i=b_0+b_1 X_{1i}+b_2 X_{2i}+...+b_k X_{ki}+\epsilon_i$
        \item Multiple regression methodology estimates the intercept and 
            slope coefficients so that $\sum_i^n \epsilon_i^2$ is minimized.
    \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Interpret estimated regression coefficients and their p-values.}
They are just simple linear functions with multiple parameters. Ignore.
\subsection{Formulate a null/alternative hypothesis, do correspoding calculations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hypothesis Testing of Regression coefficient. (Multi-parameters). \\
        Use t-statistics to determine if one parameter significantly contribute
        to the model.
        $$
            t=\frac{\hat{b}_j-b_j}{s_{\hat{b}_j}}, df=n-k-1
        $$
        where $k$ is the number of regression coefficients, and $1$ corresponds to
        the intercept term, and $s_{\hat{b}_j}$ is the coefficient standard error
        of $b_j$
    \item Determining statistical significance.
        \\ ``testing statistical significance" $\Rightarrow H_0: b_j=0, H_a: b_j\ne 0$
    \item Interpreting p-values.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Def: p-value is {\bf the smallest level of significance for 
                which the null hypothesis can be rejected.}
                \ If the p-value is less than significance level, the null 
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Other Tests of the Regression Coefficients: $H_0: a=$some value
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate and Interpret a confidence interval for the population 
value of a regression coefficient or a predicted value for the depedent variable
if an estimated regression model.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Confidence intervals for a regress. coeff.: $\hat{b}_j\pm(t_c\times s_{\hat{b}_j})$
    \item predicting the depedent variable: 
        $\hat{Y}_i=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 \hat{X}_{1i}+...+\hat{b}_k \hat{X}_{ki}$
        \\Even if you may conclude that some $b_i$ are not statistally significantly, you cannot
        treat them as $0$ and keep other parameters unchanged. You should use the
        original model, or you can throw $\hat{b}_k$ away and make a new regression model.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Assumptions of a multiple regresssion model}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear relationships exist.
    \item The independent variables are not random, and there is no exact linear relation
        between indepdent variables.
    \item $E[\epsilon|X_1,...,X_k]=0$
    \item Variance of $\epsilon=0$, i.e. $E[\epsilon_i]=0$
    \item $E(\epsilon_i\epsilon_j)=0$
    \item $\epsilon$ is normally distributed.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Calculate and interpret F-statistic}
F-test: whether at least {\bf one} of the indepedent variables explains a significant
portion of the variation of the depedent variable. F test is a one-tail test.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H_0: b1=b2=b3=0 vs H_a:$ at least one $b_j\ne 0$
    \item $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}=\frac{RSS/k}{SSE/n-k-1}$
    \item Degree of freedom: $df_{numerator}=k, df_{denominator}=n-k-1$
    \item Rules: reject $H_0$ if $F(test-statistic)>F_c(critical value)$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Distinguish between $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item coefficient of determination $R^2$: used to test if a group of indepedent
        variable can explain the depedent variable: 
        \\$R^2=\frac{total variation - unexplained variation}{total variation}
        =\frac{SST-SSE}{SST}=\frac{RSS}{SST}$
        \\{\bf Multiple R} = $\sqrt{R^2}$
    \item Adjusted $R^2$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Note: $R^2$: {\color{red}{Overestimating}}: will increase as variables are added to the model.
        Even the marginal contribution of new variables are not statistically significant.
            \item Introduce $R_a^2$: $R_a^2=1-\left[\left(\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\right)\right](1-R^2)$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Evaluate the quality of a regression model by analyzing the ouput of the equation/ANOVA table}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ANOVA Tables, some important quantities
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $R^2=\frac{RSS}{SST}$
            \item $F=\frac{MSR}{MSE}$ with $k$ and $n-k-1$ df
            \item Standard error of estimate:$SEE=\sqrt{MSE}$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Formulate a multiple regression with dummpy variables to represent qualitative factors}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Def: Some value is quite qualitative. Using dummy values like 0 or 1 
        to describe their impacts.
    \item Note: Pay attention to \# of dummy variables. If $n$ classes, we must use
        $n-1$ dummy variables.
    \item Interpreting the coefficients in a dummy variable regression. We can use F-statistics to
        test a group of parameters, or use t-test to test the individual slope coefficients.
    \item Example of Regression application with dummy variables. See Notes directly.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Why multiple regression isn't as easy as it looks?}
Pay attention to the assumptions that have been used. Violations like::
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Heteroskedasticity
    \item Serial correlation (auto-correlation)
    \item Multicollinarity
\end{enumerate}
Any violations on the assumptions will impact the estimation of SEE, and finaly 
change the t-statistic and F-statistic, and change the conclustion of the hypotesis
test.
\subsection{Types of Heteroskedasticity, how heteroskedasiticity and serial correlation affect inference}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is Heteroskedasticity?
        \\ {\bf Corresponding assumptions: Variance of the residuals is constant across observations. -- Homoskedasticity} 
        Heteroskedasity means the variance of the residuals is not equal.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unconditional heter: Not related to the level of the indepedent
                variables. Will not systematiclly increase with changes in the value
                of the indepedent variables. {\color{red}Usually will not casue major problems.}
            \item Conditional heter: Related to the level of the independent variables. Eg:
                Conditional heter exists if the variance of the residuals increase with 
                the value of the independent variables increases. {\color{red}Will cause big problems.}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Effect of Heteroskedasiticity on Regression Analysis
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unreliable standard errors.
            \item The coefficient estimates aren't affected.
            \item Will change the t-statistic, and will change the conclusion.
            \item Unreliable F-test
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Detect Heteroskedasicity
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Scatter plot
            \item Breusch-pagan test: $BP test = n\times R^2_{resid}$ with $df=k$. 
                where $n=$the number of observations, $R^2_{resid}$=$R^2$ from a second
                regression of the squared residuals from the first regression. $k=$the number
                of independent variables. If $R^2$ or BP-test are too large, something is wrong.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Correcting Heteroskedasticity
        \be
        \item Calculate robust sndard errors(White corrected std errors.). Use them for t-test.
            \item Generalized least squares. 
        \ee
    \item What is serial correlations?
        \be
            \item Def: auto-correlation, in which the residual terms are correlated.
                Common problem with time series data.
                \be
                    \item Positive serial correlation: a postive error in one time period will
                        increase the posibility to observe a positive one next time.
                    \item Negative serial correlation: Just opposite.
                \ee
            \item Effect: positive serial correlation will get small coefficient std errors. 
                Thus, too large t-statistics. therefore, too many Type I errors: reject the null
                hypothesis $H_0$ while it's actually true. 
            \item Detection:
                \be
                    \item Residual plots
                    \item Durbin-Watson statistics: 
                        $$
                        \color{red}DW=\frac{\sum_{t=2}^T (\hat{\varepsilon}_t-\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^T \hat{\epsilon}^2}
                        $$
                        For large samples, $DW\approx 2(1-r)$, where $r$ is the 
                        correlation coefficient between residuals from one period and thoese from the previous period.
                        \\Results: 
                        \be
                            \item $DW=2\Rightarrow$ Homoskedasitic and not serially correlated.
                            \item $DW<2\Rightarrow$ Postively serially correlated.
                            \item $DW>2\Rightarrow$ Negatively serially correlated.

                        \ee
                        Formulated hypothesis with DW-table, upper and lower critical values
                        \be
                            \item Hypothesis: $H_0:$ the regression has {\bf no}
                                positive serial correlation.
                            \item $DW<d_l$: positive serially correlated. Reject null.
                            \item $d_l<DW<d_u$: inconclusive results.
                            \item $DW>d_u$: {\bf There is no evidence that are positive correlated.} 
                        \ee
                \ee
            \item Correcting serial correlation:
            \be
                \item Adjust the coefficient std errors. {\bf recommended.} Using Hansen method.
                    \be
                        \item Serial correlation only: Hansen method. 
                        \item Heteroskedasticity only: White-corrected stand errors.
                        \item Both: Hans methods.
                    \ee
                \item Imporoe the specification of the model.
            \ee
    \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Multicolinearity and its cause and effects in regression analysis}
Multicollinearity: Indepedent variables or linear combinations of independent variables are highly
correlated.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Effect of Multicollinearity on Regression Analysis: Will increase the std errors of 
        the slope coefficients. {\color{red} Type II Error:
        A variable is significant, while we conclude it's not.} 
    \item Detecting: Common situation: $t-statistic$ is not significant while $F-test$ is significant.
        This tells us the indepedent variables are highly correlated.
        \\ A simple rule works if there are 2 indepedent variables: when the absolute value of the sample correlation betewen any two 
        indepedent variables in the regression is greater than 0.7.
    \item Correcting: omit one or more of the correlated indepedent variables. 
        THe problame is that it's hard to find the variables that result in the multicolinearity.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Model misspecification}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Defination of {\bf Regression model of specification}: decide which independent variables
        to be included in the model.
    \item Types of misspecification
        \be
            \item The functional form can be misspecified:
                important variables are ommited;variables should be transformed; data is improperly pooled.
            \item Explanatory variables are correlated with error term in time series model:
                A lagged dependent variable is used as an independent variable; a function of the dependent
                variable is used as an independent variable(forecasting the past);
                independent variables are measured with error.
            \item Other time-series misspecification.
        \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Models with qualitive dependent variables}
Include qualitative dependent variables, like default, bankcrupcy. Cannot use an 
ordinary regression model. Should use other models like {\bf probit and logit models}
or {\bf discriminant models}.
\be
\item Probit: normal distribution, give probability.
\item Logistic: logistic distribution. 
\item Discriminant: result in an overall score or ranking.

the estimated trend coefficients}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear Trend Model and Log-linear Trend
        \be
            \item Definition: $y_t=b_0+b_1(t)+\epsilon_t$ Note: $t$ is just time.
            \item Coefficients is determined by OLS. Ordinary least squared regression.
                \\$\hat{y}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1$
            \item Log-linear Trend Models
            \item Model: $y_t=\exp{b_0+b_1(t)}\Rightarrow \ln{y_t}=b_0+b_1(t)$
        \ee
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear model trend 
should be used}
\be
    \item Factors that determine which model is best: plot data.
    \item Limitaions of trend models: 
        \be
            \item residuals are uncorrelated with each other.
        Otherwise, it will cause auto correlation and we should not use the trend model.
            \item For log-linear model, it is not suitable for cases with serial correlations (autocorrelation).
            \item Detect auto correlation: Durbin Watson statistic. $DW=2.0\Rightarrow$ No auto correlation.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Autoregressive model, requirements for covariance statinoary}
\be
    \item Autoregressive model:
        \be
            \item Model: $x_t=b_0+b_1 x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$
            \item Statistical inferences bse on ordinary least squares estimates doesn't
                apply unless the time series is {\bf covariance stationary}.
            \item Conditions for covariance stationary
                \be
                    \item Constant and finite expected value.
                    \item Constant and finite variance.
                    \item Constant and finite covariance between values at any given lag.
                \ee
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{An autogressive model of order $p$}
\be
    \item Model(order $p$): $x_t=b_0+b_1x_{t-1}+b_2x_{t_2}+...+b_px_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t$ 
    \item Forecasting with an autoregressive model: 
        \be
            \item One-period-ahead forecast for $AR(1)$: $\hat{x}_{t+1}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 x_t$
            \item Two-period-ahead forecast for $AR(1)$: $\hat{x}_{t+2}=\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 \hat{x}_{t+1}$
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{How the residuals can be used to test the autogressive model}
\be
    \item The residual should have no {\it serial correlation} if an AR model is correct.
    \item Steps
        \be
            \item Estimate: Start with AR(1)
            \item Calculate: the autocorrelations of he model residuals
            \item Test: whether the autoccorelations are signficantly different from 0.
                \\The standard error is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$ for $T$ observations. The t-test for each
                observation is $t=\frac{\rho_{\epsilon_t,epsilon_{t-k}}}{1/sqrt{T}}$, with $T-2$ df. 
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Mean reversion and a mean-reverting level}
\be
    \item Mean reversion: The time series tends to move toward its mean.
    \item Mean-reverting level: $\hat{x}_{t+1}=x_{t}$, where $\hat{x}_t$ is the predicted value. 
    \item All covariance stationary time series has finite mean-reverting level. 
\ee
\subsection{Contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and the forecasting accuracy of 
different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion.}
\be
    \item in-sample, out-of-sample: determined by if the predicted data is in the range of 
        the observations.
    \item RMSE, root mean squared error: used to compare the accurancy. If the accurancy of 
        out-of-sample is better, you should use it for future applications
\ee
\subsection{Explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models}
\be
    \item Instability or nonstationarity. Due to the dynamic econimic conditions, 
        model coefficients will change a lot from period to period. 
    \item Shorter time series are more stable, but longer time series are more reliable.
\ee
\subsection{Random walk processes and their comparisons between covariance stationary processes}
\be
    \item Random walk: $x_t=x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$
    \be
        \item $E(\varepsilon_t)=0$: The expected value of each error is zero.
        \item $E(\varepsilon_t^2)=0$: The variance of the error terms is constant.
        \item $E(\varepsilon_i,\varepsilon_j)=0$: There is no serial correlation in the error terms.
    \ee
    \item Random walk with a Drift: $x_t=b_0+b_1 x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$, where $b_1$=0
    \item A random walk or a random walk with a drift have no finte mean-reverting level.
        Since $b_1=1,\frac{b_0}{1-b_1}=\frac{b_0}{0}$. Therefore, they are not covariance stationary.
    \item $b_1=1$, they exhibit a unit root. Thus, {\bf the least square regression that been used in 
        AR(1) will not work unless we transfrom the data}.
\ee
\subsection{Things about unit roots: when they will occur, how to test them, how to transform data to apply AR}
\be
    \item Unit root testing for nonstationarity:
        \be
            \item run an AR model and check autocorrelations
            \item perform Dickey Fuller test.
                \be
                    \item Transform: $x_t=b_0+b_1x_1+\varepsilon\Rightarrow x_t-x_{t-1}=b_0+(b_1-1)x_{t-1}+\varepsilon$
                    \item Direct test if $b_1-1=0$ using a modified t-test.    
                \ee
        \ee
    \item First differencing
        \be
            \item For a random walk, transform the data $y_t=x_t-x_{t-1}\Rightarrow y_t=\varepsilon_t$
                then start to use an AR model $y=b_0+b_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon$, 
                where $b_0=b_1=0$
            \item $y$ is covariance stationary.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{How to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model, and 
calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a sesonal lag.}
\be
    \item Detect: special autocorrelation exists for some seasonal lags.
    \item Correction: Add an additional seasonal lag term.
\ee
\subsection{Explain autogressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe
how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series}
\be
    \item ARCH: the variance of the residuals in one period is dependent on the variance of
        the residuals in a previous period.
    \item Using ARCH models:
        \\Example $ARCH(1)$: $\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2=a_0+a_1\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+\mu_t$
        if $a_1$ is significantly different from zero. $\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2$ is the squared residuals.
        \\Note: Things like generalized least squares should me used to 
                correct heteroskedasticity. otherwise, the std errors of the 
                coefficients will be wrong, leading to invalid conclusions.
    \item Predicting the variance of a time series: using ARCH model to predict the variance of 

        future periods: $\hat{\sigma}^2_{t+1}=\hat{a}_0+\hat{a}_1\hat{\varepsilon}_t^2$
\ee
\subsection{Explain How time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before
use ain a linear regression}
\be
    \item Cointegration: 
        \be
            \item Two time series are economically linked or follow the 
        same trend and that relationship is not expected to change. -- Error terms 
        from regressing one on the other is covariance stationary and the t-test are reliable.
            \item How to test conintegration: regress $y_t$ on $x_t$ 
                 $y_t=b_0+b_1x_t+\varepsilon$, $y_t, x_t$ are two different time series.
                 Then do a unit root test using the Dickey Fuller test with critical t-values
                 calculated by Engle and Granger. 
                 \\If "A unit root" is rejected $\Rightarrow$ covariance stationary, cointegrated.

                    \item Portfolio Composion mechanism. Countries with current account surpluses
                        usually have capital account deficits, which typically take the form of investments
                        in countries with current account deficits. As a result of these flows of capital, investor
                        countries may find their portfolios' composition being dominated by few investee currencies. 
                        When investor countries decide to rebalance their investment portfolios, it can have a significant negative
                        impact on the value of those investee country currencies.

                        by borrowing money from other countries. If the debt too high, lenders may question
                        the security, leading to the deprecitaion of the borrower's currency.

\section{Economic Growth and the Investment Decision}
\subsection{Compare factors favoring and limiting economic growth in developed and developing economies}
Two important factors. 1: GDP per capita. 2: Growth of GDP
\be
    \item Preconditions for Growth
        \be
            \item Saving and investment. Positively correlated with economic development.
            \item Financial markets and intermediaries. Help resources reallocation. 
                However, it may increase leverage, risks.
            \item Political stability, rule of law and property rights.
            \item Investment in human capital. Worker's skills.
            \item Tax and regulatory systems. Lower tax burdens are good.
                Lower regulation levels are good.
            \item Free trade and unrestriced capital flows.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe the relation between the long-run rate of stock market appreciation and
the sustainable groth rate of economy.}
The growth in the price is related to earnings and GDP: 
$\Delta_P=\Delta_GDP + \Delta(E/GDP)+\Delta(P/E)$.
Over the long-term, $\Delta(E/GDP)=0,\Delta(P/E)=0$. Only GDP growth matters.
\subsection{Explain why potential GDP and its growth rate matter for equity and fixed income investors.}
Higer GDP growth\ra Higher interest rates \ra Higer real asset returns.\\
Higher GDP growth makes people think that future income is increasing, therefore increase consumptions
and reduce savings. To encourage consumers save, higher interest rate is needed.

In short term, actual GDP in excess of potential GDP will result in rising prices \ra inflationary pressure.
\subsection{Distinguish between capital deepening investment and technological progress and explain
how each affects economic growth and labor productivity}
\be
    \item Factor input and Economic growth
        \be
            \item Model: 2-factor aggregate production: Y~F(L,K) at a level of tech T.
                Output Y is a function of labor(L) and capital.
            \item Cobb-Douglas Production: $Y=TK^\alpha L^{(1-\alpha)}$
                \\Dividing both sides by $L$, the output per worker is 
                $$
                    Y/L=T(K/L)^\alpha

        $$
        \Delta Y/Y=\Delta A/A+\alpha\times(\Delta K/K)+(1-\alpha)(\Delta L/L)
        $$
        i.e. growth rate in potential GDP = long-term growth of tech 
        + $\alpha$ long-term growth rate of capital
         + (1-$\alpha$)*(long-term growth rate of labor)
        \\ The growth of technology is not observable. Can be estimated from previous
        data: ex-growth rate - ex-growth rate from L and K
\ee
\subsection{Explain how natural resources affect economic growth and evaluate the arument
that limited availability of natural resources constrains economic growth}
\be
    \item Access to natural resouces does not require ownership of resources.
    \item Another theory: ownership of natural resources may actually inhibit growth. 
        \ra Dutch disease: global demand for natural resouces  drives up the coutries
        currency, making all other exports more expensive and uncompetitive.

\subsection{Explain how demographics, immigration, and labor force participation
affect the rate and sustainability of economic growth}
\be
    \item Labor Supply Factors
        \be
            \item Demographics: A countries age distribution. Countries with younger
                age will have a higher potential growth.
            \item Labor force participation.
            \item Immigration: a potential source in developed countries \Ra increase work force
            \item Average hours worked
        \ee

\subsection{Explain how investment in physical capital, human capital, and technological
development affects economic growth}
\be
    \item Human capital: knowledge and skills that individuals possess. Can be enhanced
        via education.
    \item Physical capital: infrastructure, computers, telecommunications(ICT)
        AND non-ICT capital(machineary, transportation and non-residential construction).
        More investment in physical capital \Ra Good GDP growth.
        \\ MOre investment may enhance the tech improvements.
    \item Technological development. Investment in tech will increase the productivity.
    \item Public infrastructure: like roads, bridges, and municipal facilities. 
        This will enhance total productivity. Because the private investment will not
        invest these public things for their little returns.
\ee
\subsection{Compare classical growth theory, neoclassical growth theory, and endogenous
growth theory}
\be
    \item Classical growth theory: In the long-term, population growth increases whenever
        there are increases in per capita income above subsistence level due to increase
        in capital or tech progress. \Ra Growth in real GDP per capita
        is not permanant. \Ra This is not supported by observed facts.
    \item Neoclassical Growth theory:
        \be
            \item Estimate steady state growth rate. Equilibrium economy is when the output-to-capital
                ratio is constant. When the output-capital ratio is constant, the labor-to-capital
                ratio and output per capita also grow at the equilibrium rate. Check textbooks here.
            \item Based on Cobb-Douglas function, 
                \be
                    \item Sustainable growth of output per capita: $g^\ast=\frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}$,
                        where $\theta$ is the growth rate in techonology, and $1-\alpha$ 
                        is the labor's share of GDP.
                    \item Sustainable growth rate: $G^\ast=\frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}
                        +\Delta_L$, which is the growth rate of output per  capita plus
                        the growth of labor.
                    \item Comments
                        \be
                            \item Caital deepening will not affet the growth rate in the long run.
                        \ee
                \ee
        \ee
    \item Endogenous Growth Theory
        \be
            \item Technological growth is a result of investment in physical and human capital. Returns to capital are constant.
            \item Private investments in R\&D also benefits all economy.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Explain and evaluate convergence hypoteses}
\be
    \item Absolute convergence: Less developed countries will achieve equal living standards
        overtime.
    \item Conditional convergence: Convergence in living standards will only occur for countries with the same savings rates, population
        growth rates and production functions. 
    \item Club convergence: Countries may be part of a club. Poorer countries that are part of the club will catch up
        their richer peers. Institutional changes can help a country to join the club. 
        Those are not in the club will never catch up.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the economic rationale for governments to provide 
incentives to private investments in technology and knowledge.}
R\&D are risky. Governments support may provide incentives to private R\&D, and therefore
boosts the growth of the overall economy.
\subsection{Describe the expected impact of removing trade barriers on capital investment 
and profits, employment and wages, and growth in the economies involved.}
\be
    \item Increased investment from foreign savins
    \item Allows focus on industries where the country has advantage.
    \item Increased markets
    \item Increased sharing of tech
    \item Increased competition removes bad firms and rellocating assets.

        including self-regulating organizations that regulates and represents their members.
        Outside bodies will not regulate, but their products are referenced by regulators.
\ee
\subsection{Describe uses of self-regulation in financial markets}
\be
    \item US: FINRA is an SRO recognized by SEC.
    \item In civil-law countries, independent SROs are rare, and government agencies
        fulfill the role of SROs.
    \item In common=law countries, independent SROs are historically good.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the economic rationale for regulatory intervention}
\be
    \item Economic Rationale for Regulation. Regulations are needed when
        \be 
            \item Information frictions. When information is not equally availabel or distributed.
            \item Externalities.

\ee
\subsection{Describe regulatory interdependencies and their effects.}
\be
    \item Regulatory Interdependencies.
        \be
            \item Regulatory capture theory: Regulators will at some point in time
                be influenced or controlled byt the industiry that is being regulated.
                Because the regulators will be influenced by the industry, and the
                experience will sometimes lead to impartial conclusions.
            \item Regulatory competition: Regulatory difference betweeen jurisdictions will lead to it.
                Regulators compete to provide the most business-friendly environment.
            \item Regulatory arbitrage: businesses find a coutry that best for itself.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe the tools of regulatory intervention in markets}
\be
    \item Price mechanisms
    \item Restricting/requiring certain activities. Ban certain activities or 
        require to perform some activities.
    \item Provision of public goods or financing private projects. 
\ee
\subsection{Explain purposes in regulating commerce and financial markets}
\be
    \item  Regulating commerce: Government regulations, including company laws, tax laws,
        contract laws, competition laws, banking laws, bankruptcy laws and dispute resolution systems.
        \\This laws may help or hinder commerce.
    \item REgulating financial markets: regulation of securities markets and regulation of 
                financial institutions. -- protecting investors, creating confidence in
                the markets, and enhancing capital formation.
        \be
            \item Regulation of security markets
            \item Regulation of Financial Institutions: Prudential supervision,
                the monitoring and regulation of financial institutions to reduce
                system-wide risks and to protect investors. Cost-benefit analysis should include
                hidden costs.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe anticompetitive behaviors targeted by antitrust laws globally and evaluate
the antitrust risk associated with a given business strategy.}
Antitrust regulation works to promote domestic competition. Like blocking a merger that leads to
excessive concentration of market share. International companies may be subject to antitrust
laws in different countries.
\subsection{Benefits and costs of regulation}
Costs include the implementation cost and the cost of the regulation to the private
sector.
{\it Regulatory burden}: the cost of compliance for the regulated entity. 
Regulatory burden - benefits that private sector receives = Net regulotry burden.
\subsection{Evaluate how a specific regulation affects and industry companly, or security}
\be
    \item Can help or hinder the industry or the company.
    \item Not necessarily always costly for those that being regulated.
    \item May introduce inefficiencies in the market. For example, government bailout of financial
        institutions may convey a message that companies will be helped. And the credit
        spreads will not fully reflect their risk.
    \item Certain industries have more exposure to certain types of regulations.

        :The PV of all future obligation, based on expected future salary increases.
        PVB will change from one period to the next.
        \be
            \item Current service cost: PV of benefits earned by during the current period.
            \item Interest cost: Increases in the obligation due to the passage of time.
                Interest will accrue. The cost = the pension obilgation at the beginning of
                the period times the discount rate.
            \item Past service costs: retroactive benefits awarded to employees when plan's changed.
                IFRS: expensed immediatedly. GAAP: ammortized over the average service life of 
                employees.
            \item Changes in actuarial assumptions: Gains/losses due to changes like mortality, 
                employee turnover, retirement age, and the discount rate.
            \item Benefits paid.
        \ee
    \item Balance Sheet Effects:
        \\Funded status = fair value of plan assets - PBO
        \\ Balance sheet asset(liability) = funded status. This is good for IFRS/GAAP.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the components of a company's defined benefit pension costs.}
\be
    \item Total periodic pension cost = employer contributions - (ending funded status - beginning funded status)
        \\TPPC = current service cost + interest cost - actual return on plan assets +/- actuarial losses,gains due
        to changes in assumptions affecting PBO + prior service cost.
    \item Periodic Pension Cost Reported in P\&L, i.e. Income stmt
        \be
            \item {\bf Current service cost}. Immediately recognized in income stmt.
                CSC is the increase in PBO since the employee worke one more period.
            \item {\bf Interest cost}. Immediately recognized. Increase in PBO due to the passage of time.
            \item {\bf Expected return on plan assets}. The return on the plan assets has no effect on the PBO.
                Use expected return to compute the reported pension expense. Difference
                in expected return and actual return are in "actual gains and losses"
                IFRS: expected rate of return is assumed = the discount rate to compute
                PBO.
            \item {\bf Actuarial gains and losses} Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.
                has 2 components. G/L due to changes
                in actuarial assumptions; difference in actual/expected return. 
                IFRS: not amortized. GAAP: amortized with corridor.
            \item {\bf Corridor Approach.} If G/L$>$10\% of max(begining PBO, plan assets),
                the excess amount should be amortized over the remaining service 
                life of employees. Time can be shorter if wanted, but consistent.
            \item {\bf Past(prior) service costs.} If pension plan is changed, the change
                reported in OCI. And amortized of the remainig life of affected employees. 
                In IFRS: changes are reported in income stmt instantly.

\subsection{Explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plan's assumptions on the 
defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost.}
3 Assumptions need disclosures.
\be
    \item {\bf Discount rate:} Interest rate to compute the PV of BO and the current service cost.
    \item {\bf Rate of compensation growth:} average annual increase rate of
        employee's compensation.
    \item {\bf Expected return on plan assets:} long-term rate of return on the plan's investments.
        Only good in GAAP, b/c in IFRS, it's equal to the discount rate.
\ee

To improve reports, a company
\be
    \item Increase the discount rate to reduce PBO, pension costs, and interest cost.
    \item Decrease the compensation growth rate to reduce futher benefit payments, PBO, and
        current service cost and interest cost.
    \item Increase the expected return on plan assets.
\ee
Ultimate healthcare trend rate: constant rate of a health care inflation.
\subsection{Explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other
post-employment benefits affect financial stmts and ratios.}
One need to pay attention to different assumptions when compare companies:
\be
    \item Gross vs. net pension assets/liabilities. ROA will be lower with gross
        pension A/L; leverage ratios will be higher.
    \item Differnces in assumptions used: like discount rates.
    \item IFRS, GAAP. 
    \item Difference due to classification in the income stmt. GAAP: the entire 
        periodic pension cost in P\&L, including interest are operating expense.
        IFRS: can be in various line items.
\ee
\subsection{Interpret pension plan note disclosures including cash flow related 
information.}
If the difference between cash flow and total periodic pension cost is material,
the difference can be reclassified from Operating activities to Financing activities.
\subsection{Explain issues associated with accounting for share-based compensation}
\be
    \item Forms: stock options and outright share grants.
    \item Recording: issues for stocks -- the value needs estimatings. 
    \item SHould be spread over the period for which they reward the employee.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects
financial stmts, and the importance of companies assumptions in valuing these grants
and options.}
IFRS and GAAP are similar.
\be
    \item {\bf Stock options.} Expense is based on the fair value of options. Spread over 
        the service time(grant date to the actual date that employees can act). Net income
        and retaining earnings will decrease, but total-equity will not change.
    \item {\bf Determining Fair Value.} If on-market, use market price.
        Otherwise, Using different models to find it.
    \item {\bf Stock grants.} Compensation expense is based on the fair value of
        the grant date. Allocated over the service period.
    \item {\bf Stock appreciation rights.} It's different from stock options. 
        It gives the employee the right to receive compensation based on the increase in the price
        of the firm's stock over some threshold. No shares are issued. No dillustion, but 
        the company needs to pay cash.
    \item {\bf Phantom stock.} Similar to stock appreciation rights. But is based on the 
        performance of hypothetical stock

\section{Reading 18: Multinational Operations}
\subsection{Distinguish among presentation currency, functional currency and local currency.}
\be
    \item Definition:
        \\-Local currency: currency of the country being referred to.
        \\-Functional currency: determined by the management. The main currency the company uses.
        \\-Presentation (reporting) currency: The currency the parent company prepares stmts
\ee
\subsection{Describe foreign currency transaction exposure, including accounting for and 
disclosures about foreign currency transaction gains and losses}
\be
    \item Foreign currency denominated transactions are measured in the presentation
        currency at the spot rate on the transaction date. Currency risk arises when the
        transaction date and payment date differ, leads to differnt spot rate.
    \item If balance sheet date occurs before the transaction is settled, recognize G/L in
        blance sheet, and unrealized G/L in income stmt. When the transaction settled,
        additional G/L may need to be recognized.
    \item Analyst Issues: G/L due to currency in income stmt may be in operating or non-operating
        income. B/c accounting std do not provide any guides. Pay attention to this.

\subsection{Analyze how changes in exchange rates affect the translated sales of the subsidiary
and parent company}
\subsection{Compare the current rate method and the temporal method, evaluate how each
affects the parent company's balance sheet and income stmt, and determine which method is 
appropriate in variuos scenarios.}
\be
    \item Methods to translante financial stmts of sub to parent reporting currency
        \\- Remeasurement: converting the local to functional currency with temporal method.
        \\- Translantion: convert functional currency to paraent's reporting currency
        using the currenty rate method.
        \\- Define appropriate translation method. See P64 in notes, new version.
        \\- More definitions. a) Current rate: the exchange rate on the balance sheet rate.
        b) Average rate: the average exchange rate over the reporting period. c). historical rate:
        the actual when the transactions occurs.
    \item Apply the current rate method process:
        \be
            \item All income stms are translate at the average rate.
            \item All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate 
                {\it except for common stock, at historical rate}.
            \item Dividends are at the rate that applied when they were declared.
            \item Translation G/L is reported in shareholder's equity as a part
                of the cumulative translation adjustment.
        \ee
    \item Applying the Temporal Method
        \be
            \item Monetary A/L(fixed in the amount of currency) remeasured using the current exchange rate.
            \item All other A/L are nonmonetary assets,  like inventory, fixed assets,
                intangible assets.for example, Unearned(deferred) revenue. They are 
                remeasured in hisotyrical rate. ({\it Exception: non-money A/L on the balance sheet
                at fair value are remeasured at the current rate}).
            \item Common stock, dividends paid are at historical rate.
            \item Expense related to nonmonetariy assets are remeasured based on the 
                historical rates at the time of purchase.
            \item Revenues and all other expenses are at the average rate.
            \item Remeasurement G/L is in income stmt. 
        \ee
    \item Inventory and COGS under the Temporal Method.
       \\ Numerous historical exchange rate needs to be remembered. Inventory
                are complicated. Inventory and COGS are remeasured at different rates in 
                FIFO/LIFO.
    \item Parents Company Exposure to Changing Exchange Rates
        \be
            \item In Current rate method: Exposure in the net asset position of the subsidiary.
            \item In Temporal method: net monetary A/L are exposed.
        \ee
    \item Calculating the Translation/Remeasurement G/L
        \\G/L is reported in CTA, and GTP  is used to make A=L+E.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the translation effects and evaluate the translation of a 
subsidiary's balance sheet and income }
\be
    \item -CR method: start with income stmt. As the net income here will be used 
        for the retained earnings in balance stmt.
        \\-Temporal method: start with blance stmt.
    \item Different results from CR and Temporal methods. Why?
        \be
            \item Income before translation G/L is different, due to the different 
                rate used for items. Example: COGS and depreciation, avearge rate
                in CR method and historical rate in Temporal.
            \item Translation G/L are different. Since net assets' are exposed to
                the depreciation of Local Currenty in CR, but net MONETARY assets
                are in temporal method.
            \item Net income is different. This is due to different exchange rate. Besides,
                in CR method, translation G/L are in CTA. In Temporal, remeasurement G/L are
                in income stmt.
            \item Total assets are different b/c inventory and net fixed assets are different.
        \ee
    \item

\subsection{Analyze how the current rate method and the temporal method affect financial 
statements and ratios.}
\be
    \item Pure Balance Sheet and pure Income Stmt ratios. PURE balance sheet and pure
        income statement ratios 
    \item Mixed Balance Sheet/Income Statement ratios. CR result in small changes.
        \\ Key points to remember
        \\ --Pure balance sheet/pure income ratios will be the same.
        \\ --If foreign currency is depreciating, translated mixed ratios (with
        income stmt in up and end-of-period balance sheet item down) will be larger.
    \item Compare ratios from Temporal method and current rate method. Compare the rates
        is the key.
        \be
            \item Determine whether the foreigen currency is appreciating/depre.
            \item which rates is on numberator or denominator.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Analyze how alternative translation methods for subsidiaries operating
in hyperinflationary economies affect financial stmts\& ratios}
\be
    \item Hyperinflation def. In FASB, cumulative infation $>$100\% over 3-yr
        period. IASB: doesn't have definition. But 100-3-yr is a good indication.
        Nonmonetary A/L are not affected by hyperinflation.
    \item GAAP: in hyperinflation, the parent's presentation currency is the functional
        currency. -- Temporal method 
    \item IFRS: foreigen currency stmts are restated for inflation, and then tranlated
        with CR method.
        \\--Nonmonetary A/L restated with price index.
        \\--Monetary A/L doesn't change.
        \\--Shareholder's equity are restated with price index.
        \\--Retained earnings, plug figure
        \\--Income stmt: times the change in the price index from the transaction
        date.
        \\--Net purchasing power G/L recognized in income stmt
        \\--Check the examples on P82, new notes, book2
    \item Analyzing Foreign Currency Disclosure
        \be
        \item
        --Multiple foreign subs may exist. And disclosure information are limited.
        Can be found in footnotes (financial stmt) and management discussion/analysis
        of the annual report.
        \\---Possiblie Solution:Add the change in CTA into netincome.
        \\---Also, can add the unrealized G/L to net income.
        \item 
        -- Clean-surplas accounting: add G/L that are reported in shareholder's
        equity to net income stmt.
        \\-- Dirty-surplus accounting: report G/L in shareholder's equity.

\subsection{Describe how multinational operations affect a company's effective tax rate}
\be
    \item Tax Implications of Multinational Operations
        \\--Effective tax rate: tax expense divided by pretax profit
        \\--Statutory tax rate: Provided by the tax code of the home country. 
        \\Companies needs to reconcile these two rates.
        \\Influence on the effective rate:

\subsection{Describe indicators of balance sheet quality}
\subsection{Evaluate the balance sheet quality of a company}
Completeness, unbiased measurement, clarity of presentation
\be
    \item Completeness
        \\- If off-balance-sheet liabilities exist, then need to restate the balance sheet.
        \\- Equity method can make certain ratios higher than acquisition method. If firms 
        use equity method rather than acquision method, then pay attention to it.
    \item Unbiased Measurement. Some subjectiveity:
        \\- Value of the pension liability, based on several assumptions
        \\- Value of investment in debt or equity of other companies for which
        a market vvalue is not available
        \\- Goodwill value
        \\- Inventory valuatoin
        \\- Impairment of PP\&E
    \item Clear Presentation
        \\A single-line item or items grouped together? Although standard 
        doesn't specify how much items must be presented. Clear presentation is good.

\section{Reading 20: Integration of Financial Statement Analysis Techniques}
\subsection{Demonstrate the use of a framework for the analysis of financial
statements, given a particular problem, question, or purpose. (e.g., valuing
equity based on comparables, critiquing a credit rating, obtaining a comprehensive
picture of financial leverage, evaluting the perspectives given in management's
discussion of financial results)}
Steps: in notebook.
\subsection{Identify financial reporting choices and biases that affect the quality
and comparability of companies' financial statements and explain how such biases may
affect financial decisions}
\be
    \item Sources of Earnings and Return on Equity: Use DuPont decomposition
        \be
            \item Use DuPont to find the performance drivers.
                $$
                ROE=\frac{NI}{EBT}\times \frac{EBT}{EBIT}\times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}
                \times \frac{revenue}{average assets}\times \frac{average}{average equity}
                $$
            \item Consider, if the income is generated internally or externally. Remove them
                from DuPont analysis.
            \item Rm pro-rata share of investee's earnings in influential investments.
            \item In equity method, Rm the carrying value of investments in balance sheet.
        \ee
    \item Asset Base
        \\ Try to present balance sheet items in a common-size format. To get an
        overview of the changes in the compoisition of assets over time.
    \item Capital Structure
        \\ Must be able to support management's strategic objectives as well as honor
        obligations in future.
        \\Some liabilities are more burdensome than others.
    \item Capitall Allocation Decision
        \be
            \item Financial stmts should be disaggreated by segment.
                \\- Business segment: $>$ 10\%of a large company
                \\- Geographic segement
            \item Compare methods
                \\- Compare EBIT margin to capital allocations, to see if
                the company invest on most profitable segment.
                \\- Compare cash flow generated by each segment with capital allocations
                . Cash flow $\approx$ EBIT + depreciation + amortization

\subsection{Analyze and interpret how balance sheet modifications, earnings normalization,
and cash flow statement related modifications affect a company's financial statements, financial ratios,
and overall financial condition}
\be
    \item Earnings quality and cash flow analysis
        \be
            \item Earnings quality: persistence and sustainability. Earnings closer
                to OCF are good. Check ratio of accruals to net operating assets to
                measure earnings quality. Split accruals and cash flow in earnings with balance method
                or cashflow stmt method.
            \item Accruals Ratio
                \\-Balance sheet method: 
                $$
                    Accruals = \Delta Asset - \Delta Liability - \Delta Cash=
                    NOA_{end}-NOA_{beg}
                $$
                where $NOA=Net operating asset = Asset - Liability - Cash$.
                $$
                    accrual ratio^{bs}=\frac{NOA_{end}-NOA_{beg}}{(NOA_{end}+NOA_{beg})/2}
                $$
                \\-Cash flow statement approach
                $$
                    Accruals = NI - CFO - CFI
                $$
                Higher ratio or wide fluctuated ratio are bad, indicating earnings manipulation.
                \\To compare these two measures.Eliminate cash paid for interest and taxes from OCF by adding them back. They 
                are not opearting income. -- CGO, cash generated from opeartions.

                    CGO = EBIT + non-cash charges - increase in working capital
                $$
                Compare CGO vs operating income to see if any problems.
            \item Market Value Decomposition
                \\ It's good to determine the standalone value of the parent company.

\subsection{Evaluate the quality of a company's financial data and recommend appropriate
adjustments to improve quality and comparability with similar companies, including adjustments
for differences in accounting standards, methods, and assumptions.}
\be
    \item Off-Balance-Sheet Financing
        \\Some important items are not reported on Blance sheet. Example: Opearting Leases.
        In analysis, an operating lease should be treated as a finance lease.
        \\Methods to convert operating lease:
        \\--Euqity is OK. Since assets and liabilities are increased by the same amount.
        \\--Income statement: replace the rental expense for the operating lease with 
        depreciation expense (on the lease asset) and interest expense(on the lease liability).

\section{Reading 21: Capital Budgeting}
\be
    \item Warm-up: Basics of Capital Budgeting
    \item Categories of Capital Budgeting Projects
        \\- Replacement project to maintain business
        \\- Replacement projects for cost reduction
        \\- Expansion projects
        \\- New product or market
        \\- Mandatory
        \\- Other projects
    \item Principles of Capital Budgeting
        \be
            \item Based on cash flows: 
                \\-Sunk cost: costs that cannot be avoided.
                \\Externalities: effects that the acceptance of a project
                may have on other cash flows
            \item Cash flows are based on opportunitiy costs.
                \\-OC: cash flow that the firm might lose by undertaking
                the project.
            \item The timing of cash flow is important.
            \item Cash flows are anayzed on an after-tax basis.
            \item Financing costs are reflected in the project's required rate 
                of return.
        \ee
    \item Modified Accelerated Cos Recovery System (MACRS)
        \be
            \item Definition: A depreciation method that most US companies used
                for tax purpose. Should use it as well in capital budgeting.
            \item You will have a MACRS table to compute incremental cash flows
            \item Half-year convention: asset is is in service in the middle of the
                first year. Therefore, 3-yr asset will have 4 calendar years.
            \item Depreciable basis: purchase price + any shipping or handling and
                installation costst.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the yearly cash flows of expansion and replacement
capital projects and evaluate how the choice of depreciation method affects those
cash flows}
\be
    \item Classification: 1, Initial investment outlay. 2, Operating cash flow over
        the project's life. 3, terminal-year cash flow
        \\- Initial investment outlay = FCInve + NWCInv = invest in Fixed capital
        + investment in net working capital.  NWCInv = $\Delta$non-cash current assets - $\Delta$non-debt current liabilties
            = $\Delta$NWC = changes in networking capital. Cash is not operating asset. If NWCInv is positive, cashflow will be negative. Cash
        is needed to invest in NWC.
        \\-  After-tax operating cash flows: CF = (S-C-D)(1-T)+D 
        = (Sales-Cash operating expense - Depreciation expense)(1-marginal tax rate)+D
        \\- Terminal year after-tax non-operating cash flows(TNOCF). Sometimes, NWCInv can be
        reverted at the terminal year.
    \item Expansion Project Analysis: increase both the size and earnings of a business.
        Using Initial investment outlay, After-tax ocf, and TNOCF to calculate NPV and IRR. Then 
        decide if we should accept the project.
    \item Other Presentatoin Formats.
        \\-Type: table format with cash flows collected by yr; tbl formate with cf collected by type.
    \item Replacement Project Analysis. Different from Expansion
        \\-Initial outlay, old asset will be sold: Outlay = FCInv+NWCInv-Sal$_0$+T(Sal$_0$-B$_0$)
        \\-Incremental operating CF, CF from new asset - CF from old asst: 
        $\Delta$CF=($\Delta$S-$\Delta$C)(1-T)+T$\Delta$D
        \\-TNOCF = (Sal$_TNew$-Sal$_TOld$)+NWCInv-T[(Sal$_TNew$-B$_TNew$)-(Sal$_TOld$-B$_Told$)]
\ee
\subsection{Expain how inflation affects capital budgeting analysis}
\be
    \item Analyzing nominal or real CF. Nominal CF has inflation, while real CF not. CF should be
        discounted at a correct rate. (Nominal rate or real rate.)
    \item Changes in inflation affect project profitability. Changes in inflation rate
        will change the value of future CF.
    \item Inflation reduces the tax savins from depreciation. Because the depreciation
        savings is less valuable, the tax paid is more.
    \item Inflation decreases the value of payments to bondholders.
    \item Inflation may affect revenues and costs differently.
\ee
\subsection{Evaluate cpaital projects and determine the optimal capital project in situation
of 1)Mutally exclusive projects with unequal lives, using either the least common multiple
of lives approach or the equivalent annual annuity approach, and 2) capital rationing.}
\be
    \item Mutually Exculive Projects with Different Lives
        \be
            \item Least Common multiple of lives approach. 
                \\ For example. a-3yr, b-6yr. We will use Cashflows for 2*a to compare
                with b-6yr.
            \item Equivalent annual annuity approach: Use FV=0 and current PV, to calculate
                the PMT.
        \ee
    \item Capital Rationing
        \\Firms will continue to invest in positive NPV until marginal return = marginal cost.
        \\If Firm doesn't have enough funds, it needs to allocate funds to maximize NPV.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation
can be used to asses the stand-alone risk of a capital project.}
Sensitivity analysis: change an input to see the changes in results.
\\Scenario analysis: A risk analysis technique that considers both the sensitivity of key output
variable to key input variables and the likely probability distributions of these variables. It studies
different possible scenarios, like {\it worst case, best case, base case.}
\subsection{Explain and calculate the discount rate, based on market risk methods, to use
in valuing a capital project}
\be
    \item CAPM: $R_{project}=R_F + \beta_{Project}[E(R_{MKT})-R_F]$
    \\ The calculated R is the appropriate discount rate. Also, it's the required return rate
    specific for one project.
    \item R=Hurdal rate
\ee
\subsection{Describe types of real options and evaluate a capital project using real
options}
\be
    \item Real options: allow managers to make future decisions that change the
        value of capital budgeting decisions made today.
    \item Types of real options:
        \\-Timing options: allow to delay aking an investment with the hope of having
        better information in the future.
        \\-Abandonment options: right to drop a project
        \\-Expansion options: right to make additional investments.
        \\-Fleibility options: 1. price-setting options: allow the company to change the price of
        of a product. 2. production-flexibility options: give some flexibilities in productions.
        \\-Fundamental options: projects that themselves are options. b/c the payoff
        depend on the price of an underlying asset.
    \item Evaluate project with real options. Approaches:
        \\1. Determine the NPV of the project w/t the option.
        \\2. Calculate the project NPV without the option and then add the 
        estimated value of the real option. 
        $$
            overall NPV = project NPV(based on DCF) - option cost + option value
        $$
        \\3. Use decision trees.
        \\4. Use option pricing models.
\ee
\subsection{Describe common capital budgeting pmistaks}
\be
    \item Failing to incorporte ecnomic response into the analysis. Example: 
        low barriers to entry will have more competitors.
    \item Misusing standardized templates.
    \item Pet projects of senior management. Projects backed by influential people
        are usually overrated.
    \item Basing investment decisions on EPS or ROE. Managers whose incentive is related
        related to ROE.
    \item Using the IRR criterion for project decision. NPV is good.
    \item Poor cash flow estimation.
    \item Misestimation of overheaded costs.
    \item Using the incorrect discount rate. Should use the rate for a specific project.
    \item Politics involved wity spending the entire capital budget. Spend entire budget
        and then ask for an increase for the next year.
    \item Failure to generate alternative investment ideas.
    \item Improper handling of sunk and opportunity costs. Shouldn't consider sunk costs
        in the evaluation of a project.
    \item 
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpreat accounting income and economic income in the 
context of capital budgeting.}
\be
    \item Economic income and Accounting income
        \\Economic income=cash flow + (ending market value - begin market value)
        =cash flow - economic depreciation. begining market value is PV of the remaining after-tax 
        cash flows.
        \\Accounting income=net income
    \item Difference
        \\ 1. Accounting depreciation is based on the original cost
        \\ 2. Financing costs are subtracted out to arrive at net income.
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among the economic profic, residual income, and claims valuation models
for capital budgeting and evaluate a capital project using each}
\be
    \item {\bf Economic profit:} EP=NOPAT - \$WACC=Net operating profit after tax
        -  WACC*capital. Capital = dollar amount of investment=equity + debt
        \\Returns on all supplies of income.
        \\Company value = NPV + initial capital investment
    \item MVA: market value added, is the NPV based on economic profit
        \\NPV=MVA=$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{EP_t}{(1+WACC)^t}$
    \item {\bf Residual income}: returns on equity
        \\Residual income = net income - equity charge
        \\$RI_t=NI_t-r_eB_{t-1}$. $r_e$: required return on equity.
        $B_{t-1}$: beginning of period book value of equity
        \\NPV =$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{RI_t}{1+r_e}^t$
        \\Company value = NPV + initial capital = NPV + inital euqity + debt
    \item {\bf Claims valuation approach}: Valuae debt and equity cash flows separately.
        \be
            \item Cash flows to debt holders: interest and principal payments, discounted at the cost of debt
            \item Cash flows to equity holders: dividends and share repurchases. rate at the cost of equity.
                \\ CF to equity = Operating income - principle payment to debt 
                = NI + depreciation - principal payments
            \item company value = market value of debt + mv of equity

\section{Reading 22: Captial Structure}
\subsection{Capital Structure Theory}
\subsection{Expalin the Modigliani-Miller propositions regarding capital structure,
including the effects of levergae, taxes, financial distress, agency costs, and
asymmetric information on a company's cost of equity, cost of capital, and optimal capital
structure}
\be
    \item MM Proposition I(No Taxes): The capital Structure Irrelevance Proposition
        \\Sum: MM proved that the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure
        under some restrictive assumptions.
        \\Assumptions:
        \\- Capital markets are perfectly competitve. No transactions costs, taxes,
        bankruptcy costs.
        \\- Investors have homogeneous expectations.
        \\- Riskless borrowing and lending: borrow at risk-free rate.
        \\- No agency costs: no conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.
        \\- Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions.
        \\Results: Value$_{leverge}$=Value$_{unleverage}$
    \item MM Proposition II(No Taxes): Cost of Equity and Leverage Proposition
        \\Sum: the cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion
        of debt financing.
        \\Result: 
        -Debtholders have a priority claim on assets and income, thus cost
        of debt $<$ cost of equity.
        -If the use of debt is increasing, the risk increase. Cost of equity is increasing.
        -No change in WACC
        -$r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)$; $r_e$ is the cost of CAPITAL. $r_0$ is unleveraged equity.
    \item MM Proposition I(With Taxes): Value is Maximized at 100\% Debt
        \\{\bf Tax shield provided by debt:} Firms like using debt because interest
        is tax-deductible.
        \\$V_L=V_U+(t\times d)$; Value of Leverage firm = Value of unxx firm + 
        tax rate times value of debt
        \\Value will be maximized if use 100\% debt.
    \item MM Proposition II(Wtih Taxes): WACC is Minimized at 100\% Debt
        \\$r_E=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_D)(1-T_c)$
    \item Costs and Their Potential Effect on the Capital Structure
        \be
            \item Costs of financial distress
                \\- Costs of finanical distress and bankrupty: direct(direct fees),
                indirect(lost some investment opportunities and trust from customers, suppliers, etc)
                \\- Probability of financial distress: Higer amounts of leverage result in 
                higher probabilty of distress.
                \\ Higher expected cost of fin. distress will discourage companies from debt.
            \item Agency costs of euqity: conflicts between interest between managers and shareholders.
                \\Net agency cost of euqity has 3 components
                \\- Monitoring costs: costs to supervise management
                \\- Bonding costs: assumed by manageent to assure shareholders that
                the managers are working in the shareholder's best interest.
                \\- Residual losses
            \item Costs of asymmetric information:
                \\ Resultig from the fact that managers have more infor than owners or creditors.
                \\ Shareholders creditors looking for the signals that tell what management have
                \\ - Taking on the commitment to make fixed insterest payments via debt financing
                is good. 
                \\ - Issuing equity is usually bad.
            \item Pecking order theory: signals management sends to investors via financing choices.
                \\ Managers will make financing choices that are least likely to send signal to
                investors.
                \\Choice: Internally generated equity(retained earnings) $>$ Debt $>$ External equity
                \\ Based on POT, the capital structure is the by product of the individual financing
                decision.
        \ee
    \item Static Trade-off Theory, include fin. distress:
        balance costs of fin. distress and tax shielding from debt
        \\$V_L=V_U + (t\times d)$-PV(costs of financial distress)
    \item Implications for Managerial Decison Making
        \\-MM's Propositions iwth no taxes: 1. capital structure is irrelevant with firm value. 
        2. WACC will not change. Increase use of debt will increase the cost of euqity.
        \\-MM"s Propositions with taxes: 100\% debt is good due to tax shielding.
        \\-Static trade-off theory
\ee
\subsection{Describe target capital structure and explian why a compny's actual captial
structure may flucturate around its target.}
\be
    \item Target capital structure: optiamal capital structure
    \item May flucturate
        \\- Management may choose to exploit opportunities in a specific financing source
        \\- Market value flucturation will occur, like changes in stock and bond markets.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the role of debt ratings in captial structure policy}
     Debt ratings: cost of capital is tied to debt ratings. Thus companies will keep the minimum
     ratings of debts.
\subsection{Explain factors an analysis should consider in evaluating the effect
of capital structure policy on valuation.}
Consider:
\be
    \item Changes in the company's capital structure over time
    \item Capital structure of competitiors with similar business risk
    \item Company-specific factors(like quality of corporate governance). Better 
        corporate governence will reduce agency costs.
\ee
\subsection{Describe internationa differences in the use of financial leverage, 
factors that expalin these differences and implications of these differences for investment analysis}
Capital structure of international firms will impact a firm's capital policy.
\be
    \item Total debt: Janpan, Italy, France will have more total debt in USA, UK.
    \item Debt Maturity: Co. in North Americal will use longer maturity debt than Co in Jp.
    \item Emerging market differences: Co. in developed companies will use more and longer debt
        than those in emerging markets.
\ee
Other factors are
\be
    \item Institutional and Legal factors
        \\- Strength of legal system: strong legal system results in less debt and long maturity
        in capital structure.
        \\- Information asymmetry: strong asymmetry \ra More debt. 
        \\- Taxes
    \item Financial Markets and Banking system factors
        \\- Liquidity of capital markets: larger and more liquid markets \ra longer maturity debt
        \\- Reliance on banking system: If more relian on banking systems, companies
        will be more leveraged.
        \\- Institutional investor presence: If instituional investors play more role,the
        capital structure may be changed.
    \item Macroeconomic factors
        \\- Inflation: higher inflation\ra use less debt and short maturity.
        \\- GDP growth: higher GDP growth\ra long maturity debt.

\section{Dividends and Share Repurchases: Analysiss}
\subsection{Compare theories of dividend policy and explain implications of each for share
value given a describption of a corporate dividend action}
\be
    \item {\bf Dividend irrelavance}:In a perfect world with no taxes, broker fees, and infinity
        divisiable shares, dividend policy has no effect on the price of a firm's
        stock or its cost of capital. Will not affect the required return on equity capital.
    \item {\bf Bird-in-hand argument for dividend policy}: Required return on equity capital
        $r_s$ decreases as the dividend payout increases.
    \item Tax aversion:Historically, higher tax on dividends than capital gain. Therefore, investors
        prefer to not receive dividends. While companies will make dividend payments necessary
        to avoid tax.
    \item Conclusion: 
\ee
\subsection{Describe types of information (signals) that dividend initiations, increases, 
decreases, and omissions may convey}
\be
    \item Dividend initiation: ambiuous. Positive: company is sharing its wealth; Negative: 
        a company has a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities.
    \item Unexpected dividend increase: Good.  Companies future is good.
    \item Unexpected dividend decreases or omissions: negative signals.
\ee 
\subsection{Expain how clientele effects and agency issues may affect a company's payout
policy.}
\be
    \item Clientele effect: dividend preferences of different groups are different.
        \\- Tax consideration. High tax-bracket investors(individuals) prefer low dividend
        payouts. Low-tax-bracket investors prefer high payouts.
        \\- Requirements of institutional investors: some of institu. investors
        will only invest companies that have dividend yield above some threshold.
        \\- Invdividual investor preferences.
    \item Agency issues
        \\- Between shareholders and managers: agency cost is due to difference interest
        between managers and stockholder. Manager may overinvest. Therefore, one way to reduce
        the agency cost is to increase the payout of free cash flow as dividends.
        \\- Between shareholders and bondholders: If high-risk debt outstanding, shareholders may pay
        themselves a large dividend.
\ee
\subsection{Explain factors that affect dividend policy.}
6 factors:
\be
    \item Investment opportunities. If the firm has many opportunities and need
        to react quickly, dividend payout would be low.
    \item Expected volatility of future earnings. If earnings are volatile, firms
        are more cautious in {\it changing} dividend payout.
    \item Financial flexibility.
    \item Tax considerations.
        \\- Dividend preference may different if capital gains and dividends are taxed
        at different rate.
        \\- Taxes on dividends are paid when dividend is received. Capital gain taxes
        are paid when shares are sold.
        \\- Tax-exempt institutions will be indifferent between dividends/capital gains.
    \item Flotation costs: 3\% to 7\% fee will be applied for new stocks, while retained
        earnings have no such fee. High flotation costs\ra lower dividend payout.
    \item Contractual and legal restrictions.
        \\- Impariment of capital rule: in some countries, dividend cannot be larger
        than retained earnings.
        \\- Debt covenants: many covnants require a firm to meet/exceed a certain target
        for liquidity rations and coverage ratios before they can pay a dividend.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the effective tax rate on a given currency unit of
corporate earnings under double taxation, dividend imputation, and split-rate tax systems.}
\be
    \item Double-taxation system
        \\ Earnings are taxed at corporate regardless of whether dividend. Dividend are taxed again
        for shareholders.
        \\ Effective rate = Corporate tax rate + (1-Corporate tax rate)(individual tax rate)(payout ratio)
    \item Imputation tax system
        \\ All taxes are effectively paid at the shareholder rate.
    \item Split-rate
        \\ Earnings that are distributed as dividends are taxed at a lower rate. Individual: dividends
        are taxed as income.
\ee
\subsection{Compare stable dividend, constant dividend payout ratio, and residual dividend
payout policies, and calculate the diviend under each policy.}
\be
    \item Stable Dividend Policy:
    \item Target Payout Ratio Adjustment Model
        \\ Expected dividend = previous dividend + (exp.d increase in EPS)(target payout ratio)(adjustment factor).
        Where adjustment factor = 1/number of years of which the adjustment will take place.
    \item Constant Dividend Payout Ratio Policy
        \\ Seldom used.
    \item Residual Dividend Model:
        \\ (Dividends) is based on (Earnings) less (funds retained to for the equity portion.) 
        \\ Advantages: 1. Simple to use; 2. Pursue investment opportunities without
        being constrained by dividend considerations.
        \\ Disadvantages: Dividends will be unstable.
    \item Long-term residual dividend model.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the choice between paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares}
Possible reasons to repurchase shares
\be
    \item Potential tax advantage
    \item Share price suport/signaling: company to show that they are confident with
        their stock.
    \item Added flexibility: repurchase can be a supplement to the dividend. Repurchase
        doesn't need long-term commitment.
    \item Offsetting dilution from employee stock options. 
    \item Increase financial leverage. If funded by new debt, share repurchase will 
        increase leverage. Besides, share repurchase may increase EPS, if the cost
        of fund $<$ EPS. 
\ee
\subsection{Describe broad trends in corporate dividend policies}
\be
    \item A lower proportion of US companies pay dividends compared to European ones.
    \item In developed markets, the proportion of companies paying cash dividends is down.
    \item The percentage making stock repurchases has been upwards.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret dividend coverage ratios based on 1) net income
and 2) free cash flow.}
\subsection{Identify characteristics of companies that may not be able to sustain
their cash dividend.}
{\bf Dividend safety:} the metric used to evaluate the probability of dividends
        continuing at the current rate for a company.
        \\-Useful ratios: Dividend payout ratio(dividens/net income) and 
        dividend coverage ratio(net income/dividends)
        \\Free cash flow to equity(FCEE): cash flow available for distribution
        to stockholders after working capital and fixed capital needs are accounted for.
        \\FCFE coverage ratio = FCFE/(dividends + share repurchase)


\section{Reading 24: Corporate Performance, Governance, and Business Ethics}
\subsection{Compare interest of key stakeholders gropus and explain the purpose of
a stakeholder impact analysis}
Stakeholders:
\be
    \item Definition: Groups with an interest or claim in a company.
    \item Key internal stakeholders
        \\-Stockholders
        \\-Employees

        \\-Uninons
        \\-Governments
        \\-Local communities
        \\-General public
\ee

Reconciling interests and the stakeholder analysis
\be
    \item Not all stakeholders are so interested in the profitability. e.g. Customers
        don't want to overpay. 
    \item Stakeholder Impact Analysis (SIA): Force the company to identify
        which stake groups are critical to the company.
    \item Stockholders are special stakeholders. Return on invested capital(ROIC)
        and growth in profits\ra Measure if the company satisfy shareholders
\ee

\subsection{Discuss problems that can arise in principal-agent relationships and
mechanism that may mitigate such problems.}
The Principal-Agent Relationship
\be
    \item Definition: PRA arises when one group delegats decision to another group.
    Problems: Information asymmetry. Agent doesn't tell everything to the principal.
    \item Example Problems
        \\ CEOs manipulate the board of directors to extract excessive compensation packages.
    \item Controlling PAR problems
        \\ Guide the behavior of agents
        \\ Reduce the asymmetry of information
        \\ Remove agents who misbehave and violate ethical principles.
    \item Ethics and Strategy, examples of unethical behavior

        \\Corruption
\ee
\subsection{Discuss roots of unethical behavior and how managers might ensure that ethical issues
are considered in business decision making}
Roots of Unethical Behavior
\be
    \item Personal ethics are flawed
    \item Failure to realize
    \item Culture to focus on profit/growth
    \item Flawed business culture where top management sets unrealistic goals
    \item Unethical leadership
\ee
\subsection{Compare the Friedman doctrine, Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics,
and Rights and Justicee Theories as approches to ethical decision making}
\be
    \item Friedman Doctrine: The only social responsibility is increase profits 
        ``within the rules of the game".
    \item Utilitarianism: seeks to produce the highest good for the largest number
        of people.
    \item Kantian Ethics: People are more than an economic input and desreve dignity
        and respect.
    \item Rights theories: all individuals have fundamental rights and privileges, and the
        utilitarianism's greatest good doesn't trmp these fundamental rights.
    \item Justice theories: justice is met if all participants would agree the rules
        are fair if the results is decided under 'veil of ignorance'.

\section{Reading 25: Corporate Governance}
\subsection{Describe objectives and core attributes of an effective corporate 
governance system and evaluate whether a company's corporate goverence has those
attributes}
\be

        \\CoI: crditors and suppliers; partners conflicts are addressed in contracts.
    \item Corporations
        \\Def: Distinct legal entities that have rights similar to those of an individual
        person.
        \\CoI: owners vs management
\ee
\subsection{Explain confilicts that arise in agency relationships, including
manager-shareholder conflicts and director-shareholder conflicts}
Principal-agent problem includes:
\be
    \item Managers and shareholders, examples
        \\Using funds to expand the size of the firm
        \\Get high salaries and perquisites
        \\Investing in risky ventures

    \item Directors and shareholders
        \\Lack of independene
        \\Board members have personal relationships with management

the board of directors and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of a company's corporate governance
practice}
The Board of Directors -- Standards related to the effectiveness
\\3/4 of board members should be indepedent.
\\Whether the board has an independent chairman: separate is good.
\\Qualifications of directors: should bring skills and experimence: for
board members to have the requisite industry, strategic planning, and risk management
knowledge, not serve on more than two or three boards.
\\How the board is elected: Annual elections are good
\\Board self-assessment practices
\\Frequency of separate sessions for independent directors: independent members
should meet at least annually, prefer quarterly.
\\Audit committee and audit oversight: audit comittee only has independent directors,
has expertise in financial/accounting, has full access to the cooperation management, and meets
with auditors at least annually.
\\Nominating committee: only have indepdent directors.
\\Compensation committee and the compensation awarded to management: should focus on 
long term goals. Shouldn't use the salary at other companies as a reference point. 
Good: have salaries as a small percentage of compensation, with bounus, options
and restricted stock for good performance.
\\Use of independent or expert legal counsel. Common practice: advise the board
of directors, but this is bad. Best: use independent, outside counsel whenever
legal counsel is required.
\\Statement of governance policies
\\Disclosure and transparency. Best: more disclosure is better. Should provide info
about organization structure, corporate strategy, insider transactions, compensation policies
and changes to governance structure.
\\Insider or related-party transations. Best: Any related-party transactions should be
proved by the board of directors.
\\Resonsiveness to shareholder proxy votes.  Should consider the shareholder's opinions.

\section{Mergers and Acquisitions}
\subsection{Classify merger and acquisition activities on forms of integration
and relatedness of business activities}
Forms of Integration
\be

    \item Subsidiary merger: the target company will be a sub of the purchaser.
    \item Consolidation: both companies will combine into a new company.
\ee
Types of Mergers
\be
    \item Horizontal merger: businesses in teh same or similar industries
    \item Vertical merger: the acquiring company seeks to move up/down the product
        supply chain.
    \item Conglomerate merger: two companies operate in completedly separate
        industries.
\ee
\subsection{Explain common motivations behind MA activity.}

    \item Achieving more rapid growth. 
    \item Increased market power.
    \item Gaining access to unique capabilities.
    \item Diversification: diversify the firm's cash flow. Merger are not likely to increse
        value purely for diversification reasons. B/c merger process involves a lot
        of costs.
    \item Bootstrapping EPS.

\subsection{Contrast merger transaction characteristics by form of acquisition,
method of payment, and attitude of target management}
Forms of Acquisition
\be
    \item Stock purchase: usually entire company.
        \\-Payment: directly to target company shareholders in exchange
        for their shares.
        \\-Approval: Majority shareholder approval required.
        \\-Corporate taxes: None.
        \\-Shareholder taxes: shareholders pay capital gains tax.
        \\-Liabilities Acquirer assumes liabilities of target.
    \item Asset purchase: usually part of a company
        \\-Payment: Made directly to target company.
        \\-Approval: No shareholder approval needed unless asset sale is substantial.
        \\-Corporate taxes: Target company pay capital gain tax.
        \\-Shareholder taxes: None.
        \\-Liabilities: Acquirer usually avoids assumptions of target's liabilities.
\ee
Method of Payment
\be
    \item Securities offering: pay with shares.
    \item Cash offers: pay with cash.
    \item Factors to choose securities/cashes
        \\-Distribution between risk and reward for the acquirer and target
        shareholders.
        \\-Relative valuations of companies involved. Stock offering is kind of
        a signal that acquirer's share may be overvalued.
        \\-Changes in capital structure.
\ee
Attitutde of Target management
\be
    \item Friendly merger offers process
        \\-both companies will negotiate, and draft a merger agreement, and 
        finally release all the information to the public.
    \item Hostile merger offers
        \\-Bear hug: Acquirer submits a merger proposal directly to the target's
        board of directors.
        \\-If bear hug fails, appeal directly to shareholders
        \\---Tender offer: buy the shares directly from shareholders
        \\---Proxy battle: have shareholders approve a new "acquirer approved" board
        of directors."
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among pre-offer and post-offer takeover defense mechanims}
Pre-offer and Post-offer. Pre-offer defense is better, b/c faces less scrutiny in court.
\\Pre-Offer Defense Mechanisms
\be
    \item Poison pill: give shareholder's right to buy shares at extremely
        attractive price
        \\- flip-in pill: target company's shareholders can buy target's share at a discount
        \\- flip-over pill: target shareholders can buy acquirer's shares at a discount
    \item Poison put: give bondholder's the option to get repayment immediately
    \item Restrictive takeover laws: some states in US will protect company 
        against a hostile takeover. Ohio/Pennsylvania
    \item Staggered board: Board of directors are split into 3 groups, each is 
        elected for a 3-year term. Prevent bidder controlling the board.
    \item Supermajority voting provision for mergers: require more support for 
        merger, like 66.7\%, 75\% or 80\%.
    \item Fair price amendment: restricts a merger offer unless a fair price is offered.
    \item Golden parachutes: give the managers a lot of money if they leave the company 
        after merger.
\ee
Post-Offer Defense Mechanisms
\be
    \item Just say no: target can tell shareholders merger is bad.
    \item Litigation: file a lawsuit against the acquirer that takes long time
        and a lot of money.
    \item Greenmail: payoff to the acquirer to terminate the merger.
    \item Share repurchases: target company submit a tender offer for its own shares.
        Acquirer therefore has to increase the bid price.
    \item Leveraged recapitalization: target assumes a lot of debt to repurchase
        shares. The capital structure will be unattractive.
    \item Crown jewel defense: target sell a essential subsidiary or major asset
        to a neutral theird party.
    \item Pac-Man defense: target can acuquire the aquirer.
    \item White knight defense: a white knight is a friendly third party. The friendly
        third party will start a bidding war against the acquirer.
    \item White squire defense: seek a third party to buy a minority stake
        of the company. However, the stake is big enough to block the merger.

\\Valuing a target company
\be
    \item Discounted cash flow analysis
    \item Comparable company analysis
    \item Comparable transaction analysis
\ee
\subsection{Calculate free cash flows for a target company, and estimate the
company's intrinsic value based on discount}
Dscounted Cash Flow(DCF) analysis: 1) Calculate future free cash flow.  
2) Calculated discounted cash.
\be
    \item Determine which free cash flow model to use for the analysis.
    \item Develop pro forma financial estimates.
    \item Calculate free cash flows using the pro forma data, starting with net income:
        \\
            \begin{tabular}{ll}
              & Net Income                                        \\
            + & Net interest after tax                            \\

            \end{tabular}
    \item Discounted free cash flows back to the present at the appropriate 
        discount rate. Usually use WACC, or WACC$_{adjusted}$ which includes the risk
        from the merger.
    \item Determine the terminal value and discount it back to the present.
        \\Method 1: assumes the company grows at a constant rate. 
        $$
            terminal value = \frac{FCF_T (1+g)}{WACC_{adjusted}}-g
        $$
        Method 2: $Terminal value_T=FCF_T\times (Projected price/FCF)$

\subsection{Estimat the value of a target company using comparable company
and comparable transaction analyses}
Comparable company analysis
\be
    \item Identify the set of comparable firms: same industry with similar size and capital structure.
    \item Calculate various relative value measures basaed on the current market price
        of companies in the sample with some useful quantities: 
        \\-Enterprise value(EV)=market value of debt and equity - the value of cash and investments.
        \\-Price to earnings P/E
        \\-Price to book P/B
        \\-Price to sales P/S
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics for the relatie value metrics and apply
        those measures to the target firm.
    \item Estimate a takeover premium:$TP=\frac{DP-SP}{SP}$, where TP: takeover premium,
        DP: deal price per share, SP: target company's stock price. The takeover
        premium is estimated by looking at recent takeovers on similar companies.
    \item Calculate the estimated takeover price for the target as the sum of
        estimated stock value based on comparable and the takeover premium.
\ee
Comparable transaction analysis: using recent takeover transactions of similar
companies to estimate the takeover price.
\be
    \item Identify a set of recent takeover transactions. Should be firms
        in the same industray and have a similar capital structure.
    \item Calculate various relative value measures baesd on \textbf{completed deal prices} for
        companies in the sample. 
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics for the relative value metrics and apply
        those measures to the target firm.
\ee
\subsection{Compare the discoutned cash flow, comparable company, and comparable transaction analyses 
for valuing a target company, including the advantages and disadvantages of each.}

\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-relatively eash to model
        \\-based on forecasts of conditions in the future
        \\-the model is easy to customize
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Hard to apply when free cash flows are negative
        \\-estimates of CF and earnings have error.
        \\-Discount rate changes over tive
        \\-Estimation error
\ee
Comparable company analysis: use market data from similar firms AND a takeover 
premium
\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-Data for comparable companies is easy to access
        \\-Assumptions that similar assets have similar value is good.
        \\-Estimates of value are from the market.
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Assumes that the market valuation of the comparable companies is accurate
        \\-Just get a fair stock price. Takeover premium must be determined.
        \\-Difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures
        in analysis.
        \\-Historical data for premiume estimate may not be timely.
\ee
Comparable transaction analysis: uses data from completed M\&A deals
\be
    \item Advantages
        \\-No need to estimate takeover premiums
        \\-Estimates of value from actuall M\&A deals
        \\-Reduce the risk that shareholders sue that the managers/BoD for 
        mispricing the deal. 
    \item Disadvantages
        \\-Assumes that M\&A transactions are valued accurately.
        \\-Not enough transactions to use.
        \\-Difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changin capital structure.

\subsection{Evaluate a takeover bid, and calculate the estimated post-acquisition
value of an acquirer and the gains accrued to the target shareholders versus the
acquirer shareholders.}
\be
    \item Post-Merger Value of an Acquirer: $V_{AT}=V_{A}+V_T+S-C$, where 
        $V_{AT}$ is the post-merger value of the combined company, $V_A$, $V_T$ are
        acquirer and target, $S$ is synergies, and $C$ is the cash paid to target
        shareholders.
    \item Gain Accrued to the Target: $Gain_T=TP$=Takeover premium=$P_T-V_T$
    \item Cash payment VS Stock payment
        \\-Cash payment: price is just the cash
        \\-Stock payment: $P_T=N\times P_{AT}$=number of new shares$\times$price 
        per share of combined firm after the merger announcement.
\ee
Check the examples in notes. P306-Vol2
\subsection{Explain how price and payment method affect the distribution of risks and benefits 
in M\&A transactions}
\be
    \item Effect of price: acquirer hopes buy low, target hopes to sell high.
    \item Effect of Pyament Method
        \\-Cash offer: acquirers assumes the risk and the potential reward.
        \\-Stock offer: some of the risk and potential rewards frmo the
        merger shift to the target.
\ee
\subsection{Describe characteristics of M\&A transactions that creat value}
\be
    \item Short term: target's stock price gains \~30\%, and acquirer's lose 1\%~3\%
        \\-Winner's curse: the firm who wins will overpay the most
        \\-Managerial hubris: managers overestimate the synergies and expected benefits.
    \item Long term: Acquirers tend to underperform their peers
    \item mergers enhance value for the acquirer
        \\-Strong buyer: acquirers that have strong performance in the prior 3 yrs.
        \\-Low premium
        \\-Few bidders
        \\-Favorable market reaction
\ee
\subsection{Distinguish among equity carve-outs, spin-offs, split-offs and liquidation}
    Diverstitures: a company selling, liquidating, spinning off a division  or subsidiary.
\be
    \item Equity carve-outs: create a new company. Shares are issued in public. 
    \item Spin-offs: create a new company. Shares are not issued to public but distributed
        to shareholders of parent company.
    \item Liquidations: break up the firm, and sell assets.
\ee
\subsection{Explain common reasons for restructuring}
\be
    \item Division no longer fits into management's long-term strategy.
    \item Lack of profitability
    \item Individual parts are worth more than the whole.

\be
    \item Sum-of-the-parts value: company operates mutiple divisions. Analyst value
        individual parts and add them.
    \item Conglomerate discount: investors apply a markdown to the value of a company that
        operates in many unrelated divisions.
        \\Reason
        \\-Internal capital inefficiency
        \\-Endogenous(internal) factors

\section{Reading 28: Return Concepts}
\subsection{Distinguish among realized holding period return, expected holding period return, required return
, return from convergence of price to intrinsic value, discount rate and internal rate
of return.}
\be
    \item Hoding Period Return: $r=\frac{P_1-P_0+CF_1}{P_0}=\frac{P_1+CF_1}{P_0}-1$
    If the CF is received before the end of the period, CF$_1$=the cash flow received
    and the interest earned.
    \\Holding period return is annualized.
    \item Realized and Expected Holding Period Return
        \\Realized return: historical return based on past prices/Cf
        \\Expected return: forecast
    \item Required return: minimum return an investor requires given the asset's risk. 
        \\Also called Opportunity cost.
        \\ Expected return greater(less) than required return\ra Undervalued(Overvalued)
    \item Price Convergence: Expected return = required return + $\frac{V_0-P_0}{P_0}$
    \item Discount Rate: 
    \item Internal Rate of Return: Rate that makes PV of CF = The current price of securities
        \\In efficient market, IRR=required return
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret an equity risk premium using historical and forward-looking
estimation approaches}
Background:
\be
    \item Equity risk premium: The return in excess of risk-free rate = required return on equity
    index - risk-free rate
    \item Required return for individual stocks = rfr+$\beta_j\times$ (equity risk premium)
\ee
Estimates of The Equity Risk Premium:
\be
    \item Historical Estimates: use mean market return and mean rfr
        \\-Strength: Objectivity, simplicity, unbiase`d
        \\-Weakeness: i) Assume mean/variable constant over time. ii) Biased by survivorship
    \item Forward-Looking Estimates: use current informatin and expectations on
        economic/financial variables.
        \\-Strength: doesn't rely on stationary assumption; less influenced by
        survivorship.
        \\-Three model: Gordon growth, supply-side, estimate from survays
\ee

Three main
\be
    \item Gordon Growth Model=constant growth model
        \\GGM equity risk premium = (1-year forecasted dividend yield on mkt index)
        + (consensus long-term earnings growth rate) - (long-term government bond yield))
        =$D_1/P + \hat{g}-r_{LT,0}$
        \\-Weakness:i) this estimation will change over time. ii)Assume stable growth rate
    \item Supply-Side Estimates(Marcoeconomic Models): based on relations between
        macroeconomic variabls and financial variables.
        \\-Strength: proven models and current information
        \\-Weakness: only good for developed countries
        \\-Model: ERP=$[1+\hat{i}]\times[1+\hat{rEg}\times[1+\hat{PEg}]]-1+\hat{Y}
        -\hat{RF}$
        \\where $\hat{i}$=expectaion inflation, $\hat{rEg}$=expected real growth in EPS,
        $\hat{PEg}$=expected changes in the P/E ratio, $\hat{Y}$=the expected yield on the index,
        $\hat{RF}$
    \item Survey Estimates: easy to obtain, but may has a wide disparity.
\ee
\subsection{Estimate the required return on an equity investment using the capital asset
pricing model, the Fama-French model, the Pator-Stambaugh model, macro-economic multifactor models,
and the build-up method.}
\be
    \item Capital Asset Pricing Model
        \\Required return on stock j = risk-free rate + equity risk premium $\times$ beta of j
    \item Multifactor models
        \\Required return = RF + risk premium$_1$ + risk premium$_2$ + ... + risk premium$_n$
        \\risk premium$_i$=factor sensitivity$\times$ factor risk premium
    \item Fama-French Model: accounts for the higher returns associated with small-cap stocks
        \\required return of stock j=RF + $\beta_{mkt,j}\times(R_{mkt}-RF)+
        \beta_{SMB,j}\times(R_{small}-R_{big})+\beta_{HML,j}\times(R_{HBM}-R_{LBM})$
        \\ $(R_mkt-RF)$ = return on a value-weighted market index - risk free rate; 
        \\$R_{small}-R_{big}$ = a small-cap return premium equal to the average
        return on small-cap portfolis - the average return on large-cap portfolios;
        \\ $R_{HBM}-R_{LBM}$=a value return premium equal to the average return on high-book-to-market
        portolios - the average return on low-book-to-market portfolios
        \\Expected value for $\beta_{mkt,j}=1$, latter two $\beta$ are 0
    \item Pastor-Stambaugh Model: adds a liquidity factor to the F-F model.
        base: 0; less liquid: positive $\beta$
    \item Macroeconomic Multifactor Models: use multiple factors and correspoding beta. Burmeister, Roll, and Ross Model:
        \\-Confidence risk
        \\-Time horizon risk
        \\-Inflation risk
        \\-Business cycle risk
        \\-Market timing risk
        \\Add RF and beta times these risks.
    \item Build-up method: good for a company where betas are not readily obtainable
        \\Required return = RF + equity risk premium + size premium + specific-company premium
    \item Bond-Yield Plus Risk Premium Method: good for a company with publicly traded debt
        \\Risk Premium = Risk premium + the YTM of Long-term debt
\ee
\subsection{Explain beta estimation for public companies for public companies, thinly
traded public companies, and nonpublic companies}
\be
    \item Beta Estimates for Public Companies
        \\-Public company: compute by regressing the returns of stock on the returns
        of the overall mkt.
        \\-Common Index: SP500, NYSE; Common time scale: 5 years of monthly or 2 years of weekly data.
    \item Adjusted Beta for Public Companies
        \\-beta drift: tendency of an estimated beta to revert to 1.0 over time
        \\-Blume method: adjusted beta = (2/3 regression beta) + (1/3$\times$1.0)
    \item Best Estimates for Thinly Traded stocks and Nonpublic Companes
        \\Steps
        \\-Find a benchmark company XYZ, publicly traded and similar
        \\-Estimate the benchmark beta
        \\-Find Unlevered beta: unlevered beta for XYZ = (beta of XYZ) $1/(1+debt of XYP/equity of XYZ)$
        \\-Estimated beat for ABC = unlevered beta of XYZ $\times (1+debt of ABC/equity of ABC)$

        \\W: use historical values that may or may not be relevant to current market conditions
\ee
\subsection{Explain international considerations in required return estimation}
Need to consider the exchange risk. Two models
\be
    \item Country Spread Model: Use a developed market as benchmark and add a risk premium
        (difference between the yield on bonds)
    \item Country Risk Rating Model: Use a model, and take the risk rating as 
        independent variable.

    \item Selling General and Administrative Costs(SG\&A)
        \\-SGA operating expenses are less sensitive to changes in sales.
        \\-SGA selling and distribution costs are more directly related to sales volumes.
    \item Financing Cost: interest for debt/equity financing
        \\-Net Debt: gross debt - cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities
        \\-Net interest expense: gross interest expense - interest income on cash/short-term debt

\section{Reading 30:Discounted Dividend Valuation}
\subsection{Compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs
to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which
each measure is suitable}
Dividend discount models:
\be
    \item Definition: DDM define cash flow as the dividends to be received by the
        shareholders.
    \item Advantages and dis
        \\-A: theoretically justified; dividends are less volatile than other measures
        \\-DA: hard for firms that don't pay dividends; dividend policy may be controled by someone,
        therefore doesn't show the expected cash flow to share holders
    \item Appropriate for
        \\-Companies that have a history of dividend payments
        \\-Dividend policy is clear and related to the earnings of the firm
        \\-when The valuation Perspective is that of a minority shareholder
\ee
Free cash flow to the firm(FCFF):
\be
    \item Definition: Cash flow generated by the firm's operations that in excess
        of the capital investment required to sustain the firm's current productive
        capacity. 
    \item Free cash flow to equity: cash available to stockholders after funding captial and
    and expenses related with debt financing
    \item Adavantage and disadvantage
        \\-A: good for many firms
        \\-Dis: i) Company may have negative CF for many years.
    \item Appropriate for
        \\-Firms do not have dividend payment history or payment history is not related
        to earnings
        \\-firms which CF corresponds to earnings
        \\-when valuation perspective is of a controlling shareholder.
\ee
Residual income
\be
    \item Definition: RI - earnings that exceeds the investor's required return. 
    \item Advantage and dis
        \\-A: good for companies with negative cf and to divident-and non-dividend-paying
        firms
        \\-Dis: require in-depth analysis on accountings. 
    \item Appropriate:
        \\- firms that do not have dividend histories

        \\-Firm expects to pay a dividend,$D_1$, in one year
        \\-Dividends grow in a costant rate $g$
        \\-the growth rate $g$ is less than the required return $r$
    \item Formula:
        $V_0=\frac{D_0(1+g)^1}{1+r}+...+\frac{D_0(1+g)^n}{(1+r)^n}=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}

\subsection{Describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and
justify its selection to value a company's common shares}
\be
    \item Strength:
        \\-good for stable, mature, dividend-paying firms
        \\-good for valuing market indices
        \\-easily communicated and explaind
        \\-Can be used to determin price-implied growth rates, required rates

\ee
\subsection{Explain the assumptions and justify the selection of the two-stage DDM,
the H-model, the three-stage DDM, or spreadsheet modeling to value a company's common
shares}
\be
    \item Two stage DDM:
    \\the company grows at a high rate for a short time, then back to a long-run
        perpetual growth rate. ie. Dividend growth rates will change.
    \item H-Model:
        \\ The growth rate will declines linearly over the high-grwoth stage
        until it reaches the long-run average growth rate.
    \item Three-stage DDM: good for firms that have three distinct stages of earnings growth.
    \item Spreadsheet modeling: in practice, use spreadsheets to model any pattern of dividend
        growth every year.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the growth phase, transitional phase, and matruity phase of a business}
\be
    \item Initial growth phase: rapidly increasing earnings, little or no dividends, and heavy reinvestment
    \item Transition phase: earnings and dividends are increasing but still low
    \item Maturity phase: earnings growth at a stable but slower rate, payout ratios
        are stable, ROE=required rate of return
\ee
\subsection{Describe terminal value and explain alternative approaches to determining
the terminal value in a DDM}
Ways to determin the terminal value:
\be
    \item Gordon growth model: at some point of futre, assume dividends will begin
        to grow at a constant.
    \item Market price multiples: estimate market price multiples, and using it to
        estimate future price.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the value of common shares using the two-stage of DDM, 
the H-model, and the three-stage DDM.}

        V_0=\sum_{t=1}^n\frac{D_0(1+g_s)^t}{(1+r)^t}+ \frac{D_0(1+g_s)^n(1+g_L)}{(1+r)^n(r-g_L)}
        $$
    \item Valuation using the H-Model
        $$

market based on a DDM estimate of value.}
If market price higher than the DDM price, then it's overvalued. 

\section{Reading 31: Free Cash Flow Valuation}
Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow removes cash to pay operation expense, working capital
investment, and fixed capital investment.\\
FCFF: cash available to stockholder's and bondholders.
\subsection{Compare the FCFF and FCFE approaches to valuation.}
\be
    \item Firm value = FCFF discounted at WACC
    \item Equity value = FCFE discounted at required return on equity
    \item Equity value = Firm value - Market value of debt
\ee
Difference between FCFF and FCFE:
\be
    \item FCFE is easier and straightforard
    \item FCFF is good if the firm has significant debt outstanding.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach}
Ownership perspective
\be
    \item Free cash flow approach
        \be
        \item Control perspective: for an acquirer, who can change the firm's dividend policy
        \item For minority shareholders perspective
        \ee
    \item Dividend approach
        \\ Perspective: minority owner. They have no direct control over the firm's dividend
        policy.
\ee
Why prefer Free Cash Flow than dividend-based valuation?
\be
    \item Companies pay no/low cash dividends.
    \item Dividends are decided by the board of directors. Not align with the firm's long-run profitability.
    \item Free Cash Flow are better if the company is an acquisition target. B/c new owners
        might change the distribution of dividends.
    \item FCF is more related to long-run profitability.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, EBIT, EBITDA, CFO to calculate
FCFF and FCFE}
Terms:
\be
    \item EBIT: Earnings before inteerest and taxes
    \item EBITDA: Earnigns before interest, taxes, depreciations, and amortization
    \item CFO: Cash flow from operations
\ee
Calculating FCFF from net income: 
\\FCFF = NI + NCC + Int$\times$(1-tax rate)-FCInv-WCInv
\be
    \item NCC(non cash charges): like amortization of intangible assets, amortization of a bond discount, 
        deferred taxes.
    \item Fixed capital investment: they do not appear on the income statement, but they represent
        cash leaving the firm.
        \\FCInv = Capital expenditures - proceeds from sales of long-term assets
        \be
            \item If no long-term assets were sold:FCInv = ending net PP\&E - beginning PP\&E + depreciation
            \item If long-term assets sold: FCInv = ending net PP\&E - beginning PP\&E + depreciation - Gain on sale.
        \ee
        \be
            \item Working capital investment: Change in working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, notes payble, 
                and the current portion of long-term debt
            \item Interest expense: should add it back.
        \ee
\ee
Other Formulas:
\be
    \item Calculating FCFF from EBIT:
    \\FCFF=EBIT$\times$(1-tax rate)+Depreciation - FCInv - WCInv
    \item Calculating FCFF from EBITDA
        \\FCFF=EBITDA$\times$(1-tax rate) + Dep$\times$tax rate - FCInv - WCInv
    \item Calculating FCFF from CFO
        \\FCFF=CFO+Int$\times$(1-tax rate)-FCInv
    \item Calculating FCFE from FCFF:
        \\FCFE=FCFF-Int$\times$(1-tax rate)+net borrowing
    \item Calculating FCFE from net income
        \\FCFE=NI+NCC-FCInv-WCInv+Net borrowing
    \item Calculate FCFE from CFO:
        \\FCFE=CFO-FCInv+Net borrowing
\ee
Free Cash flow with Preferred stock
\be
\item FCFF/FCFE above assume that the company only have debt and common equity.
Preferred stock dividends should be added back to get FCFF. PS can be considered as
debt, but dividends are not tax deductible.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate FCFF and FCFE}
\be
    \item FCFF = Changes in cash balance + Net payments to debt providers
        + Net payments to equity stakeholders
    \item FCFE = Changes in cash balances + Net payments to equity stakehoders
\ee
\subsection{Describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE}
Two approaches
\be
    \item Historical Free Cash Flow:
        \\-Assumptions: constant growth, constant fundamental factors
    \item Components of free cash flow
        \\-Assumptions: each component grow at different rate; ties sales forecasts
        to future captial expenditures, depreciation expenses, and changes in working
        capital
        \\-IMPORTANT: Capital expenditures\ra i) Outlays that are needed to
        maintain existing capacity: current levels of sales; ii) Outlays that are
        needed to support growth: predicted sales growth.
\ee 
Forecasting FCFE with the second method, Target debt-to-asset ratio for the new
investment is fixed in Fixed Capital and Working Capital
\\FCFE=NI-(1-DFR)$\times$(FCInv-Dep)-(1-DR)$\times$WCInv
\subsection{Compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models}
The FCFE: control perspective\\
Dividend discount: Minority perspective
\subsection{Explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes
in leverge may affect future FCFF and FCFE}
dividends, share repurchases, share issues have no effect on FCFF and FCFE
\\Changes in leverge have no effects on FCFF and minor effects on FCFE.
\subsection{Evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation}
Net income: Poor for FCFE
\\FCFE=NI+NCC-FCInv-WCInv+net borrowing
\\EBITDA: poor for FCFF
\\FCFF=EBITDA$\times$(1-tax rate)+Dep$\times$tax rate-FCInv-WCInv
\subsection{Explain the single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage FCFF nd FCFE models
and select and justify the appropriate model given a company's characteristics}
Single-Stage FCFF Model
\be
    \item Assumptions: i)FCFF grows$@$constant g. ii)growth rate$<$WACC
    \item Eqution: Value of the firm = $\frac{FCFF_1}{WACC-g}$=
        $\frac{FCFF_0\times (1+g)}{WACC-g}$
\ee
Single-stage FCFE Model
\be
    \item Assumptions: Similar to FCFF
    \item Value of the equity = $\frac{FCFE_1}{r-g}$=
        $\frac{FCFE_0\times (1+g)}{r-g}$
    \item Often used in international valuation
\ee
Multistage Models: How Many Variations are there?
\be
    \item key: Value = PV of expected future CF discounted at the appropriate discount rate
    \item Comparisons
        \\-FCFF VS FCFE: FCFF - WACC, FCFE - required return on equity
        \\-Two stage vs three stage: just different time scale
        \\-Forecasting growth in total free cash flow (FCFF or FCFE) VS forecasting
        the growth rates in the components of free cash flow: These two models are good.
\ee
Model Assumptions and Firm Characteristics
\be
    \item Two- or three stage? two stage: short-term supernormal growth; three-stage: like
        growth phase, mature phase, and a transistion phase
\ee
\subsection{Estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow models}
Examples on Vol 3 P137
\subsection{Explain the use of lsensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE Valuations}
\be
    \item Sensitivity analysis: how sensitive an analyst's valulation results are to changes
        in each of a model's inputs
    \item Two majors sources
        \\- Estimate the future growth in FCFF and FCFE, growth forecasts depend on a firm's
        future profitability.
        \\- The chosen base years for FCFF or FCFE growth forecasts
\ee
\subsection{Describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in multistage valuation model}
Two way
\be
    \item Use single-stage model, assume that the forecasted FCFF and FCFE will grow at
        the long-term stable growth rate after some time
    \item Use multiples: 
        \\- Terminal value in year n = trailing P/E$\times$ earnings in year n
        \\- Terminal value in year n = leading P/E$\times$ earnings in year n+1
\ee

\subsection{Distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on
forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation, and
explain economic rationales for each approach.}
\be
    \item Method of comparables: values a stock based on the average price multiple
        of the stock of similar companies
        \\- Law of One Price
    \item Method of forecasted fundamentals: values a stock based on the ratio of
        its value from a discounted cash flow model to some fundamental variables.
        \\- Value = PV of all future cash flows
\ee 
\subsection{Calculate and interpret a justified price multiple}
\subsection{Describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples
and dividend yield in valuation}
\subsection{Calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield}
Justified price multiple: The multiple when the stock is fairly valued.
\\P/E Ratio: price to earnings
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\A: popular used, P/E differences different significantly related to long-run average
        \\DisA: Earnings can $<$0, Earnings can be volatile, earnings can be distored in reports.
    \item Equation:
        \\Trailing P/E = Mkt Price per Share/EPS over previous 12 monthes. 
        \\Leading P/E = Mkt Price per Share/EPS expected over next 12 months
\ee
P/B Ratio: price to book value
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\A: Book value usually$>$0; Bv mare stable than EPS; Good for firms
        that hold liquid assets; good for firms that are expected to go out of business;
        good to explain differences in long-run average stock returns
        \\DisA: exclude intangible economic assets; misleading; accounting conventions may
        different; inflation/techo change will change the book value/mkt values of assets
    \item P/B ratio = Mkt value of equity/book value of equity = Mkt price pshare/BValue pshare
        \\Book value of equity = Common shareholder's equity = Total Assets - total liabilities - Preferred stock
\ee
P/S Ratio: price to sale
\be
    \item A and DisA
        \\A: always positive; hard to manipulate sales; not volatile; good for
        mature/cyclical industries or start-up
        \\DisA: high growth in sales$\neq$high profit; P/S ratio doesn't describe
        cost structures; revenue recognization may be distorted.
    \item P/S ratio= Mkt value of equity/total sales 
\ee
P/CF ratio: price to cash flow
\be
    \item A: CF is hard to manipulate; P/CF more stable than P/E
    \item Dis: If we use CF=Eps + noncash charges, noncash revenue and net changes
        in working capital are ignored, though they will affect actual cash flow;
        FCFE is preferable to operating CF, however, FCFE is more volatile.
\ee
Dividend Yield: common dividend to the market price
\be
    \item A and DisA:
        \\-A: dividend yield contributes to total investment return; dividends are not as risky as the 
        capital appreciation component of total return
        \\-DisA: DY doesn't include capital appreciation;
    \item Equation
        \\ Trailing D/P = 4$\times$ most recent quarterly dividend/mkt price ps
        \\ Leading D/P = forecasted dividends over next four quarters / mkt ps

\subsection{Calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing
earnings per share(EPS), and calculate normalized EPS}
Underlying Earnings: 
\be
    \item Definition: earnings - nonrecurring components(gain/loss from asset
sales, asset write-downs, provisions for future losses, and changes in accounting estimates)
    \item Molodovsky effect: earnings have a transitory portion that is due to
        cyclicality. In business cycles, P/Es will be high due to lower EPS at the bottom of the cycle
        and low P/Es due to high EPS at the top of the cycle.
\ee
Normalized Earnings: use estimate of EPS in the middle of business cycle
\be
    \item Method of historical average EPS: average EPS over some recent period
    \item Method of average return on equity: average return on equity times the 
        current book value per share = average ROE$\times$BVPS. --Preferred.

\subsection{Calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional
regression on fundamental, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression
methodology}
\be
    \item Calculation: linear regression of hisotrical P/Es on fundamental variables.
    \item Limitations
        \\-Predictive power of the estimated P/E for a different is uncertain
        \\-Relationships between P/E and the fundamental variables examined may
        change over time
        \\-Multicollinearity, makes it difficult to interpret individual regression coefficients

\subsection{Evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals
in using method of comparables}
\subsection{Evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons
of multiples}
Use multiples to value stocks
\be
\item P/E
\be
    \item P/E Multiples$<$the benchmark\ra Undervalued
    \item Usual P/E multiples
        \\-P/E of another company's with similar properties
        \\-average or median peer group
        \\-P/E of an index
        \\-average historical P/E for the stock.

The Fed and Yardeni models
\be
    \item Fed model: the overall mkt overvalued when the earnings yield(E/P) on
        the SP500 $<$ the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds.
    \item Yardeni model
        \\-CEY=CBY-k$\times$LTEG+$\varepsilon_i$
        \\CEY=Current earnings yield of the market; CBY=current Moody's A-rated

\subsection{Calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth ratio(PEG) and explain its use
in relative valuation}
$$
PEG ratio = \frac{P/E ratio}{g}
$$
PEG ratio ``standardizes'' the P/E ratio for stocks with different growth rates.
Small PEG ratio\ra better.
\\Drawbacks:
\be
    \item P/E and g is not linear.
    \item PEG ratio doesn't account for risk.
    \item PEG ratio doesn't reflect the duration of the high-growth period
        for a multistage valuation model.

\subsection{Calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal
value in a multistage discounted cash flow model.}
Two methods:
\\1. based on fundamentals
\be
    \item Terminal value in year n = justified leading P/E $\times$ forecasted earnings
        in year n+1
    \item Terminal value in year n = justified trailing P/E $\times$ forecasted earnings
        in year n
\ee
2. based on comparables
\be
    \item Terminal value in year n = benchmark leading P/E $\times$ forecasted earnings
        in year n+1

multiples and describe limitations of each definition}
Definitions of cash flow available for use in calculating the P/CF
\be
    \item Earnings-plus-noncash charges(CF)
    \item Adjusted cash flow (adjusted CFO)
    \item Free cash flow to equity(FCFE)
    \item Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization(EBITDA)
\ee
Earnings-plus-noncash-charges(CF)
\be
    \item Definition: CF=net income + depreciation + amortization
    \item Limitation: it ignores items that affect cash flow, like noncash revenue 
        and changes in net working captial.
\ee
Cash Flow from Operations or Adjusted CFO
\be
    \item How to adjust for nonrecurring cash flows: 
        \\-GAAP: interest paid/received, dividends received to be classified
        as operating cash flows
        \\-IFRS: interest paid in Operating/Financing, interest and dividends
        received in Operating/Investing
\ee
FCFE/EBITDA:
\be
    \item FCFE=CFO-FCInv+net borrowing, where FCInv = fixed capital investing,
        net borrowing = (long- and short-term debt issues)-(long- and short-term
        debt repayments)
    \item EBITDA
\ee
P/CF ratio=markt value of equity/cash flow = mkt price per share/cash flow per share
\subsection{Calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use EV/EBITDA}
\be
    \item Enterprise value(EV) = market value of common stock + mkt value of preferred equity
+ mkt value of debt + minoirty interest - cash and investments
    \item EV/EBITDA ratio = Enterprise value/EBITDA
    \item EBITDA = recurring earnings from continuing operations + interest
        + taxes + depreciation + amortization
        \\=EBIT + deprecitation + amortization
\ee
EV/EBITDA good/bad
\be
    \item Good
        \\-good when comparing firms with different degrees of financial leverages
        \\-EBITDA is useful for valuing capital-intensive businesses with high levels of depreciation and amortization
        \\-EBITDA is usually positive
    \item Bad
        \\-EBITDA might overstate CFO
        \\-FCFF has the amount of capital expenditures, it's more related
        with valuation theory.
\ee
Alternative to EV: Total invested capital(TIC)=mkt value of invested capital=mkt value of 
companies equity and debt.
\subsection{Explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons}
\be
    \item Differences in accounting methods, cultures, risk, and growth opportunities.

\be
    \item Momentum indicators: mkt price/fundamental variable to the time seris of historical/expected
    value. 
    \\-Example: earning surprise, stdized unexpected earnings, relative strengh.
\ee
Common momentum indicators
\be
    \item Unexpected earnings/earnings surprise=reported EPS-expected EPS
    \item Standardized unexpected earnings(SUE):
        SUE=earnings surprise/standard deviation of earnings surprise
    \\Std comes from historical data.
    \item Relative strength indicators: compare a stock's price or return performance
        with is own historical performance.

\subsection{Explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the weighted harmonic mean,
and the meian to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples}
Use Weighted harmonic mean to calculate Portfolio or index P/E:
$$
WHM = \frac{1}{\sum_i=1^n \frac{w_i}{X_i}}
$$
where $X_i$ is the P/Es, $w$ is the weights.

\subsection{Calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market
value added.}
Definitions 
\be
    \item Residual income = economic profit = net income of a firm - a charge that measures stockholder's
opportunity cost of capital.
    \item Residual income explicitly deducts all capital costs.
\ee
EVA and MVA
\be
    \item Econmic value added: EVA = NOPAT - (WACC$\times$total capital) = [EBIT$\times$(1-t)]-\$WACC
        \be
            \item Use beginning year capital
            \item Terms:
                \\NOPAT= Net opearting profit after tax(before substrating interest expenses)
                \\t=marginal tax rate
                \\ \$WACC= dollar cost of capital
                \\ total capial=net working capital + net fixed assets

            \item Adjustments that may needed
                \\-Capitalize and amortize research and development charges, and add them
                back to earnings to get NOPAT.
                \\-Add back charges on strategic investments that will generate returns in the future
                \\-Eliminate deferred taxes an consider only cash taxes as an expense.
                \\-Treat operating leases as capital leases
                \\-Add LIFO reserve to invested capital and add back change in LIFO reserve to 
                NOPAT.
        \ee
    \item Market value added: MVA = market value - total capital=mkt value of 
        equity and long-term debt - book value of invested capital

\subsection{Describe the use of residual income models}
For the exam\ra Use residual income models to value equity and goodwill impairment.
\subsection{Calcualte the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model
and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models}
\be
    \item Equation:
        \\$RI_t=E_t-(r\times B_{t-1})=(ROE-r)\times B_{t-1}$
        \\ $r$= required return on equity; $E_t$=expected EPS for year t.
        \\ $B_{t-1}$=book value per share in year t-1

\subsection{Explain fundamental determinants of residual income}
Single-stage residual income valuation model
\be
    \item Equations:
        $$
            V_0=B_0+[\frac{(ROE-r)\times B_0}{r-g}]
        $$
    \item Assumptions:
        \\-Constant dividend/earnings growth rate
        \\-Stock is correctly valued: $V_0=P_0$
    \item Fundamental drivers of residual income
        \\- ROE must be greater than $r$ to get additional value.
    \item Tobin's Q:
        \\Q=(mkt value of debt + mkt value of equity)/(replacement cost of total assets)
        \\=total mkt value of firm/total asset value of firm

\subsection{Explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified
price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals.}
Residual income models are most closely related to the price-to-book value.
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using
single-stage(constant-growth) and multistage residual income models.}
Just check the examples in the Notes. Nothing special here.
\subsection{Calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market
price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on euqity.}
Use equation:
$$
g=r-[\frac{B_0\times(ROE-r)}{V_0-B_0}]
$$
\subsection{Explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing
residual income at the forecast horizaon, given company and industry prospects}
Continuing residual income:
\be
    \item General summary: forecast short-horizon(5 years) residual income, and then use assumptions
        for long-term residual income.
    \item Persistence factor:$\omega$, the projected rate at which the residual income is going
        to fade over the life cycle of the firm
    \item Assmumptions(use one of below)
        \\-Residual income will persist at its current level forever
        \\-Residual income will drop to zero immediately
        \\-Residual income will decline over time as ROE falls to the cost
        of equity
        \\-Residual income will decline to a long-run average level consistent
        with a mature industry
    \item Eqution:
        $V_0=B_0$+PV of hig-growth RI + PV of continuing residual income
        \\NOTE: PV of continuing residual at the end of year T-1 = RI$_T$/(1+r-$\omega$)
\ee
\be
    \item Assumptions 1: Residual income persist at the current level forever
        \\$\omega=1$
        \\PV of continuing residual income in year T-1 = RI$_T$/r
    \item Assumptions 2: Residual income drops to 0
        \\$\omega=0$
        \\PV of continuing residual income in year T-1 = RI$_T$/(1+r)
    \item Assumptions 3: Residual income declines over time to zero
        \\$\omega\in[0,1]$
    \item Assumptions 4: Residual income declines to long-run level in mature industry.
        \\PV of continuing residual in year T = P$_T$ - B$_T$, where P$_T$=mkt value.
        \\-Estimate P$_T$: P$_T$=B$_T\times$ Price-to-book value
        \\-PV of coninuing residual income in year T-1 = $(P_T-B_T+RI_T)/(1+r)$
        
\ee
\subsection{Comapre residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models}
DDM and FCFE: Discounting expected cash flows.
\\RI: starts with a book value.
\subsection{Explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify
the selection of a residual income model to value a company's common stock.}
\be
    \item Strength:
        \\-Terminal value does not dominant.
        \\-RI use accounting data.
        \\-Applicable to firms that do not pay dividends or do not have positive FCF
        \\-applicable when CF is volatile 
        \\-Focus on economic profitability
    \item Weakness
        \\-rely on accounting data, which may be manipulated
        \\-Need many adjustments
        \\-Assumes that $B_t=B_{t-1}+E_t-D_t$ holds(clean surplus model). However, any accounting charges
        that taken directly to equity accounts will break this relation, like currency
        translation gains/losses.
\ee
When to use RI models or not?
\be
    \item When:
        \\-firms do not pay dividends, or payments too volatile
        \\-Expected FCF are negative
        \\-Terminal forecast is highly uncertain
    \item Not
        \\-Clean surplus model broke.
        \\-Estimates of book value and ROE is uncertain.
\ee
\subsection{Describe accounting issues in applying residual income models.}
Clean surplus violations, delete them
\be
    \item Foreign currency translation gains/losses that go to retained eranings
    \item Certain pension adjustments
    \item Gain/losses on certain hedging instruments
    \item Changes in revaluation surplus for long-lived assets. IFRS only.
    \item Changes in the mkt value of debt and equity that classified as available-for-sale.
\ee
Variations from Fair Value: accrual method may make book value are different from market values
\be
    \item Operating leases should be capitalized rather than expensed.
    \item Special purpose entities' A/L should be consoliated to the parent company.
    \item Reserve and allownaces should be adjusted.
    \item Inventory with LIFO should be adjusted to FIFO.
    \item Pension asset or liability should be adjusted to reflect the funded 
        status of the plan.
    \item Deferred tax liabilities should be eliminated and reported as equity if
        it's not going to reverse.
\ee
Intangible Asset Effects on book value
\be
    \item Intangibles recognized at acquisition
    \item R\&D expenditures: productive R\&D increase ROE and RI.
\ee
Nonrecurring items and Other Aggressive Accounting Practices: Shouldn't include them to
calculate CONTINUING RI.
\\International Accounting Differences.
\subsection{Evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued or undervalued
based on a residual income model.}
Market price$>$model price\ra Overvalued.


\section{Reading 34: Private Company Valuation}
\subsection{Compare public and private company valuation}
\be
    \item Company-Specific Factors
        \\-Stage of lifecycle: usually less mature, but sometimes mature firms/bankrupt firms near liquidation.
        \\-Size: less capital, fewer assets, and fewer employees. Riskier.
        \\-Quality and depth of management: maybe bad than public firms
        \\-Management/shareholder overlap: substantial ownership position, long-term perspective
        \\-Short-term investor: public firms usually take a shorter-term view, b/c shareholders
        often focus on short-term performance
        \\-Quality of financial and other information: less information about financial
        disclosures.
        \\-Taxes: private firms will be more concerned with taxes than public firms
    \item Stock-specific fators
        \\-Liquidity: equity has fewer potential owners, less liquid
        \\-Restrictions on marketability: have agreement for not selling shares
        \\-Concentration of control: concentrated in a few shareholders
\ee
\subsection{Describe uses of private business valuation and explain applications
of greatest concern to financial analyst}
3 Reasons: transactions, complicance, and litigation
\be
    \item Transaction-Related Valuation
        \\-Venture capital financing: valuation subject to negotiation and informal
        \\-Initial public offering(IPO): use values of similar public firms as benchmark
        \\-Sales in an acquision
        \\-Bankruptcy proceedings
        \\-Performance-based managerial compensation
    \item Compliance-related valuations
        \\-Financial reporting: often related to goodwill impairment test
        \\-Tax purposes
        \\-Litigation-Related valuation: shareholder suits, damage claims, lost profits claims
        or divorce settlements
\ee
\subsection{Explain various definitions of value and demontrate how different definitions
can lead to different estimates of value}
Definitions of Value: depends on what valuation will be used for
\be
    \item Fair market value: for tax purposes
    \item Fair value for financial reporting
    \item Fair value for litigation
    \item Market value: used for real assets where purchase will be levered.
    \item Investment value: value to a particular buyter
    \item Intrinsic value
\ee
The effect of Value Definition on Estimated Value
\be
    \item The definition of value affects the estimated value of an asset.
    \item The valuation should be used for its intended purpose.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the income, market, and asset-based approaches to private company
valuation and factors relevant to the selection of each approach.}
Three approached:
\be
    \item Income approach: value a firm as PV of expected future income
    \item Market approach: value a firm using the price multiples
    \item Asset-based approach: values a firm's asset - liabilities
\ee
Related issues
\be
    \item Selection: depends on the firm's operations and its lifecycle stage
        \\-Early: asset-based
        \\-Developing: income approach
        \\-Mature: market approach
    \item Firm size: parameters from large benchmark company shouldn't be used in small companies
    \item Should include both Operating/nonoperating assets
\ee
\subsection{Explain cash flow estimation issues related to private companies
and adjustments required to etimate normalized earnings}
Normalized earnings: ``Firm earnings IF the firm were acquired." Adjustments needed are
listed below.
\\Estimating Normalized Earnings
\be
    \item Exclude nonrecurring and unusual items. Adjustments may be needed for highly concentrated
        small firms, like internal transactions between the firm and its owner.
        \\-Example: high management compensation\ra normalized earnings will be larger than reporting earnings
        low management compensation\ra normalized earnings will be smaller than reporting earnings
    \item Company owned real estate: should be separated from the firm's operations
        \\Treatment: remove related income/expense. Use market lease rates.
\ee
Strategic and Nonstrategic Buyers
\be
    \item Strategic buyers: need to consider the perceived synergies related to other assets
    \item Nonstrategic buyers: no synergies
\ee
Estimating Cash Flow
\be
    \item Controlling/uncontrolling equity interests will have different values
    \item Scenarios should be considered if there is significant uncertainty
        \\-Development: sale of the firm, IPO, bankruptcy, continued private operation
        \\-Mature firm: different assumed growth rates
    \item Aware: management may be biased on future estimates
    \item FCFF/FCFE: FCFF is more approprite when significant changes are anticipated.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the value of a private company using free cash flow, 
capitalized cash flow, and/or excess earnings methods}
ALL of them are based on INCOME APPROACH
\be
    \item Free Cash Flow
        \\-Terminal value: usually five years out. 
        \\-use constant growth model/price multiple approach
        \\-NOTE: double counting. In a high growth industry, PE ratio may resulted in double
        counting growth.
    \item Capitalized Cash Flow
        \\-Good for: no comparables are available, projections are uncertain and stable
        growth is reasonable
        \\-Value of firm = FCFF$_1$/(WACC-g), where FCFF$_1$ is the expected free
        cash flow to the firm over the next year.
        \\-Value of equity = FCFE$_1$/(r-g)
    \item Retained Earnings/Excess Earnings
        \\-Starts with the earnings that SHOULD be generated by working capital and fixed assets
        \\-- Excess earnings= firm earnings - required return of earnings
        \\-- Value of intangible assets = PV of the stream of excess earnings. Using the excess earnings
        and the growing perpetuity formula from Capitalized Cash Flow.
        \\--Check EXAMPLES!
\ee
\subsection{Explain factors that require adjustment when estimating the discount rate
for private companies}
\be
    \item Size premiums: small companies may have finanical distress. Size premiums are added
        to the discount rates for small private companies.
    \item Availability and cost of debt: prt companies have less access to debt, and WACC will be higher
    \item Acquirer versus target: some acquirer will incorrectly use their own cost of capital(low) to 
        get a wrong high value of target company.
    \item Projection risk: information avaiability; inexperienced manager forecasting
    \item Lifecycle stage
\ee
\subsection{Compare models used to estimate the required rate of return to private company,
(for example, the CAPM, the expanded CAPM, and the build-up approach}
\be
    \item CAPM: Beta is estimated from public firm data. Not good for private firms that won't go public
    \item Expanded CAPM: Includes addtiontional premiums for size and firm-specific(unsystematic) risk
    \item Build-up method: Used when it's impossible to find comparable public firms to estimate beta.
        Beginning with the expected return on the mkt, and add premiums for small size, industry
        factors, and company specific factors.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the value of a private company based on market approach methods and describe
advantages and disadvantages of each method}
Three main methods: Guideline Public Company (GPCM), Guideline Transactions Method (GTM), Prior Transaction Method (PTM)
\\ Marekt approaches are preferred over income and asset approaches.
Basic issues:
\be
    \item When choosing public comparables, consider industry, operations, size, and lifecycle.
    \item Large private firm valuation is usually EBIT or EBITDA multiples, and Market Value of Invested Capital(MVIC) as numerator.
    \item Small private firms: usually use net income multiples. A revenue multiple might be used for extremely 
        small firms.
\ee
GPCM
\be
    \item Use price multiples from trade data for public companies.
    \item Evaluating a controlling equity interest in a private firm, control premium should be considered.
        , becase public trades transactions are for small noncontronlling interests.
        \be
            \item Transaction type: finanancial transactions has a smaller price premium.
            \item Industry conditions: Sometimes, there is a flurry in industry acquisition activitity, which
                drives up acquisition prices. Control premium are somewhat included in such markets.
            \item Type of consideration: Historical Acquisitions may involve stocks, and the value are "bubbled", which
                may overstate the estimation of the control premium.
            \item Resonableness: The estimation of control premiums should be checked.
        \ee Controlling premium only applies to the equity portion of the firm's value. Two way to include:
            \\-Use raw multiple to estimate firm value, estimate the equity portion, and apply the control premium to the equity
            portion.
            \\-Adjust controlling premium: Ajusted premium = (control premium on equity)$\times$(1-DR), where DR = debt-to-asset
            ratio of the private company.
    \item 
\ee
GTM
\be
    \item Prior acquistion values for entirme companies are used, and no additional
        adjustment for a controlling interest is necessary.
    \item Issues related to limitie information of private companies
        \be
            \item Transaction type: need to adjust the historical multiple, if data
                is strategic transaction while the valuated subject is non-strategic
                transition.
            \item Contingent consideration: if part of the acquisition price is contingent
                on the achievement of specific company performance, analysts should be
                pay more attention when comparing transactions without such contingencies.
            \item Type of consideration: stock transactions or cash transactions.
            \item Availability of data: relevance and accurancy of the historical data
            \item Date of data
       \ee
\ee
Price Transaction Method
\be
    \item Use transactions data fro the stock of the actual subject company. Most
        appropriate when valuing minority interests.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the assetbased approach to private company valuation}
\be
    \item Value of the firm =  fair value of its assets - fair value of its liabilities
    \item Usually not used. Because it's easier to find comparable data at the firm level
        than asset level; difficult to find intangible assets data
    \item Results in lowest valuation, bc firm's assets combination together will have more
        value than just simply sum them together\ra 1+1$>$2
    \item Good for
        \\-Firms with minimal profits and little hope for better prospects
        \\-Finance firms such as banks
        \\-Investment companies such as real estate investment trusts and closed-end
        investment companies where the underlying assets values are determined using
        the market or income approaches.
        \\-Small companies or early stage companies with few intagible asests
        \\-Natural resource firms
\ee
\subsection{Explain and evaluate the effects on private company valuations of discounts
}
Adjustments are needed when liquidity or control position of an anquisition differs from 
that of the comparable companies: Comprable data is controlling interest, and subject valuation
is noncontrolling interest. --Lack of Control and Lack of Marketability
\\The Discount for Lack of Control (DLOC)
\be
    \item DLOC = 1 - 1/(1+control premium)
\ee
The Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)
\be
    \item If an interest in a firm cannot be easity sold, DLOM is needed.\
    \item Estimate DLOM:
        \be
            \item Compare the price of restricted shares to the price of the
                publicly traded shares.
            \item Compare the price of pre-IPO shares and post-IPO shares. Issues here:
                post-IPO price are thought to have more certain cash flows and lower risk,
                therefore not purely reflect changes in marketability.
            \item Use the price of put-opiton divided by the stock price, where the put
                used is at the money.
        \ee
    \item TOTAL disount = 1 - [(1-DLOC)(1-DLOM)]
\ee
\subsection{Describe the rold of valuation standards in valuing private companies}
Two stds:
\be
    \item Uniform Standards of Professional Apprasial Practice (USPAP) from US Appraisal Foundation 
    \item International Valuation Standards from International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC)
\ee
Challenges
\be
    \item Not required to follow these standards
    \item Hard to follow standards
    \item Valuation reports are private. Hard to ensure the compliance of the standards.

\section{Reading 35: The Term Structure and Interest Rate Dynamics}
\subsection{Describe relationships among spot rates, forward rates, yield to maturity,
expected and realized returns on bonds, and the shape of the yield curve}
\be
    \item Spot Rates: P$_T$=1/(1+S$_T$)$^T$
    \item Forward Rates: annualized interest rate on a loan to be initiated
        at a future period is the forward rate.
    \item Yield to Maturity: included coupon payments, and the spot rate of each
        coupn might be different. YTM is a summary parameter.
    \item Expected and Realized Returns on Bonds: ex-ante holding period return that a 
        bond investor expects to earn.
        \\When: 1. The bond is held to maturity, all payments are mad on time and full, 
        and all coupons are reinvested at the original YTM, the expected return =
        YTM
\ee
\subsection{Describe the forward pricing and forward rate models and calculate forward
and spot prices and rates using those models.}
\be
    \item The Forward Pricing Model: arbitrage-free pricing 
    \item The Forward Rate Model: $[1+S_{j+k}]^{j+k}=(1+S_j)^j[1+f(j,k)]^k$, 
        where $f$ is the forward rate.
\ee
\subsection{Describe how zero-coupon rates (spot rates) may be obtained from the par
curve by bootstrapping.}
Par rate: YTM of a bond trading at par.
\\ Par rate curve: par rates for bonds with different maturities.
\\ Par rate = the coupon rate on the bond.
\subsection{Describe the assumptions concerning the evolution of spot rates in relation 
to forward rates impolicit in active bond portfolio management.}
Relationships between Spot and Forward Rates
\be
    \item Upward-sloping spot curve\ra Forward rate rises as $j$ increases
    \item Upward-sloping spot curve\ra Forward curve will be above the spot curve
\ee
Forward Price Evolution
\be
    \item If future spot rates evolves as forecasted by the forward curve, the forward
        price will remain unchanged.
    \item Spot rate lower than the forward curve\ra forward price up
\ee
\subsection{Describe the strategy of riding the yield curvea}
``Riding the Yield Curve''
\be
    \item Maturity matching: purchasing bonds that have a maturity = investment horizon
    \item "Rolling down the yield curve": If the yield curve remains unchanged, you can buy
        a long-maturity bond, and sell it before its maturity. 
\ee
\subsection{Explain the swap rate curve and why and how market participants use it in
valuation}
The Swap Rate Curve
\be
    \item plain vanilla interest swap: A pays on a fixed rate, B pays on a floating rate.
        \\- the fixed rate\ra swap fixed rate OR swap rate
    \item swap rte curve is preferred as a benchmark interest rate curve.
        \\- reflects the credit risk of commercial banks
        \\- swap mkt is not regulated by government, therefore comparable across
        different countries.
        \\- Has yield quotes at many maturities.
    \item Wholesale banking uses Swap rate; Retail banking uses government bond yield curve
    \item Calculating SFR
        $$
            \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{SFR_T}{(1+S_t)^t}+\frac{100}{(1+S_T)^T}=100
        $$
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the swap spread for a given maturity}
Swap spread:
\be
    \item Definition: the swap rate exceeds the yield of government bond with the 
        save maturity
    \item swap spread$_t$ = swap rate$_t$ - Treasury yield$_t$
\ee
I-spread:
\be
    \item The amount by which the risky bond exceeds the swap rate for the same 
        maturity. Linear interpolation for missing swap rates.
    \item I-spread reflects compensation for risk.
\ee
Describe the Z-spread
\be
    \item Definition: the spread that, when added to each spot rate on the default-free
        spot curve, makes the present value of a bond's cash flows equal to the bond's
        market price.
    \item zero-volatility: assumption of zero interest rate volatility.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the TED and Libor-OIS spreads}
TED Spread
\be
    \item Definition: T: T-bill, ED: Eurodollar futures contract
        \\The amount by which the interest rate on loans between banks (3-mon LIBOR)
        exceeds the interest rate on short-term US government debt(3-mon T-bills)
    \item Indication of the risk of interbank loans. Captures the risk in the banking system.
\ee
LIBOR-OIS Spread
\be
    \item OIS: Overnight Indexed Swap. Reflects the federal funds rate. Includes minimal credit risk.
    \item LIBOR-OiS spread: LIBOR rate - OIS rate
\ee
\subsection{Explain traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates
and describe the implications of each theory for forward rates and the shape of the
yield curve}
Unbiased Expectation Theory/Pure expectation theory:
\be
    \item Main point: Investor's expectations determine the shape of interest rate
        term structure. 
    \item Example: 
        \\A. Investor hsould earn the same return by investing in a 5-yr bond, or by
        investing in a 3-yr bond and then a 2-yr band.
        \\B. with 3-yr horizon, investors will be indifferent between 3-yr bond or 5-yr bond.
    \item Behind point is: risk neutrality. Investors don't demand a risk-premium for 
        maturity strategies that differ from their investment horizon.
\ee
Local Expectations Theory
\be
    \item Main point: preserves risk-neutrality assumption only for short holding periods.
    \item Not hold.
\ee
Liquidity Preference Theory
\be
    \item Main point: Forward rates reflect investors' expectations + a liquidity premium
        to compensate investors for exposure to interest rate risk.
    \item Implication:  Forward rates  are biased estimates of the market's expectation of
        future rates.
\ee
Segmented Markets Theory
\be
    \item Main Point: The shape of yield curve is determined by the preferences of borrowers
        and lenders -- supply and demand for loans of different maturities.
\ee
Preferred Habitat Theory
\be
    \item Main point: Forward rates represent expected future spot rates plus a premium. The
        premiums are related to supply and demand for funds at various maturities, give incentives
        to investors to shift from their preferred maturity.
\ee
\subsection{Describe modern term structure models and how they are used.}
Equilibrium Term Structure Models: use fundamental economic variables
\be
    \item Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model: interest movements depends on whether people
        choose consumption or investing today
        \be
            \item $ dr=a(b-r)dt+\sigma\sqrt{r}dz $
                \\dr = change in the short-term interest rate
                \\a = speed of mean reversion parameter.
                \\b = long-run value of short-term interest rate
                \\t = time
                \\$\sigma$ = volatility
                \\dz = a small random walk movement
        \ee
    \item The Vasicek Model
        \\$dr = a(b-r)dt + \sigma dz$.
\ee
Arbitrage-free Models: assumes that bonds trading now are correctly priced.
\be
    \item Ho-Lee Model: $dr_t=\theta_t dt + \sigma dz_t$
        \\-$\theta_t=a time-dependent drift term$
        \\-Using market prices to find the drift term
\ee
\subsection{Explain how a bond's exposure to each of the factors driving the yield
curve can be measured and how these exposures can be used to manage yield curve}
Managing Yield Curve Risks: risk to the portfolio value to changes in the yield curve.
\\Sensitivity measures:
\be
    \item Effective Duration: price sensitivity to a small parallel shifts in the yield curve.
    \item Key Rate Duration: the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in a single
        par rate. (percentage change in the value in respone to a 100 basis point change
        in the correspoing key rate, all other rates are constant.)
        \\  Example: a portfolio has 3 bond. 1-yr, 5-yr, 25-yr. Key rate durations: $D_1=0.7,
        D_2=3.5,D_{25}=9.5$,
        $\Delta_P/P \approx -D_1\Delta r_1-D_5\Delta r_5 - D_{25}\Delta r_{25}$
    \item Sensitivity to Parallel, Steepness, and Curvature Movements
        \be
            \item Level$\Delta x_L$: parallel increase/decrease
            \item Steepness $\Delta x_S$: Long-term interest rates increase while short-term rates decrease
            \item Curvature $\Delta x_C$: short-term and long-term rates increase, while intermediate
                rates do not change.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Explain the maturity structure of yield volatilities and their effect on price
volatility}
Term structure of interest rate volatility: Yield volatility versus maturity.
\\Long-maturity volatility $<$ Short-term volatility
\\Long-maturity volatility\ra uncertainty regarding real economy and inflation. 
\\Short-maturity volatility\ra risks regarding monetary policy.

\section{Reading 36The Arbitrage-Free Valuation Framework}
\subsection{Explain what is meant by arbitrage-free valuation of a fixed-income instrument.}
Arbitrage-free valuation: no one can earn arbitrage profit.
Arbitrage opportunities
\be
    \item Value additivity: value of whole differs from the sum of the values of parts
    \item Dominance: one asset trades at a lower price than another asset with identical characteristics
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the arbitrage-free value of an option-free, fixed-rate coupon bond.}
Method: Discount cash flows using the corresponding spot rate.
\subsection{Describe a binomial interest rate tree framework}
Binomial interest rate tree: interest rates have an equal probability of taking one of
possible values in the next period.
\\ Model: Lognormal random walk.
\eq{
    r_1& = r_0 \exp{m_1 h\pm\sigma\sqrt{h}}\\
    r_2& = r_0 \exp{m_1 h+\pm\sigma\sqrt{h}+m_2 h\pm\sigma\sqrt{h}}
}
\subsection{Describe the backward induction valuation methodology and calculate the value of a 
fixed income}
Valuing an Option-Free Bond with the Binomial Model
\be
    \item Backward induction: just binomial tree calculations. See examples in LOS 36d.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the process of calibrating a binomial interest rate tree to spcific
term structure.}
3 Rules needed
\be
    \item Tree should generate arbitrage-free values for the benchmark security.
    Value generated = the actual market value of benchmark security to make sure the model works.
    \item Adjacent forward rates are $e^{2\sigma}$
    \item Middle forward rate in a period $\approx$ the implied one-period forward rate for that period.
    Because there might be some drifting terms, we can use this method to calibrate interest rate.
\ee
\subsection{Compare pricing using the zero-coupon yield curve with pricing using an
arbitrage-free binomial lattice.}
zero-coupon yield curve = spot rate curve. Discount all future cash flows based on 
the interest rate. Only good for option free options.
\\Binomial tree can valuate bonds with options.
\subsection{Describe pathwise valuation in a binomial interest rate framework and 
calculate the value of a fixed-income instrument given its cash flows along each path.}
Pathwise Valuation: calculate bond's value based on each possible path, and then average
all possible values.
\subsection{Describe a Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation and its application.}
Path Dependency:
\be
    \item Typical problem: Prepayments on underlying residential mortgages. This risk
    is affected by interest level AND interest path.
    \item Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation: good for path-dependent problems. Note, 
    rates should be calibrated to get a arbitrage-free valuation.
\ee


\section{Reading 37: Valuation and Analysis: Bonds with Embedded Options}
\subsection{Describe fixed-income securities with embedded options}
Simple Options
\be
    \item Callable bonds: give the issuer the option to call back the bond.
        \\-European: option can only be exercised on maturity
        \\-American: can be exercised at any time after the lock out period
        \\-Bermudan-style: can be exercised at fixed dates after the lockout period
    \item Putable bonds: investor can sell bond back to the issuers
        \\-Extendible bond: allows the investor to extend the maturity of the bond.
    \item Complex options:
        \\-Estate put: allows the heirs of an investor to put the bond back to the issuer
        upon the death of investor.
        \\-Sinking fund bonds(sinkers): requires the issuer to set aside funds periodically
        to retire the bond.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the relationships between the values of a callable or putable
bond, the underlying option-free (straight) bond, and the embedded option.}
\eq{
    V_{call}&=V_{straight}-V_{callable}\\
    V_{putable}&=V_{straight}+V_{put}
}   
\subsection{Describe how the arbitrage-free framework can be used to value a 
bond with embedded options.}
\subsection{Calculate the value of a callable or putable bond from an interest rate
tree.}
Rate used in binomial tree for option-embedded bonds: one-period forward rates instead
of spot rates.
\\ Call Rule: value at any node = min(issuer call the bond, issuer not call the bond.)
\\ Put Rule: value at any node = max(investor put the bond, investor not put the bond.)
\subsection{Explain how interest rate volatility affects the value of a callable 
or putable bond.}
\be
    \item Option values positively related to the volatility of their underlying.
    \item Value of straight bonds is affected by tchanges in the level of interest rate 
    but unaffected by the volatility.
    \item Volatilty of interest increases, value of callable cond decreases but value of putable bond
    increases.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how changes in the level and shape of the yield curve affect the value 
of a callable or putable bond.}
\be
    \item Level of Interest Rates: 
        \\-Interest rate down\ra value of callable bonds rises slower than straight bond.
        \\-Interest rate up\ra value of putable bonds falls slower than straight bond.
        \\-Call option value is inversely related to the interest rate; put option value positively related to ir.
    \item Shape of the Yield Curve
        \\-Call option value will become lower along an upward sloping yield curve.
        \\-Put option value: vice versa.
\ee
\subsection{Explain the calculation and use of option-adjusted spreads.}
\be
    \item Option Adjusted Spread: value added to the interest rate to show the credit risks. 
    Otherwise, the calculated price will be lower.
        \\-Note: OAS are added after the adjustment for the embbed options. (Call/Put rule)
    \item Uses: similar bonds should have similar OAS. Higher OAS\ra undervalued, good to invest.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how interest rate volatility affects option adjusted spreads}
 \be
     \item For callable bonds, interest rate volatility increases\ra calculated price of bonds
     down\ra OSA will be smaller.
     \item Putable bonds, interest rate volatility increase\ra calculated price of bonds 
     up\ra OSA up.
     \item Assumed level of volatility will affect OSAs. 
 \ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret effective duration of a callable or putable bond}
Effective duratioin, effective convexity: good for bonds with embedded bonds.
\be
    \item Effective duration = ED = $ (BV_{-\Delta y}-BV_{+\Delta y})/(2BV_0\Delta y) $
    \item Effective convexity = EC = $ (BV_{-\Delta y}+BV_{+\Delta y}-2BV_0)/(BV_0\Delta y^2) $
        \\-$\Delta y$ is the change in required yield.
    \item Steps
        \\1. Use assumped interest rates, volatility to calculate OAS.
        \\2. Add a small shift in the benchmark yield curve, build a new bionomial
        tree, add OAS from 1. Calculate new $BV$.
\ee
\subsection{Compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds}
\be
    \item ED$_{callable}$ $<$ ED$_{straight}$
    \item ED$_{putable}$ $<$ ED$_{straight}$
    \item ED$_{zero-coupon}$ $\approx$ maturity of the bond
    \item ED$_{fixed rate}$ $<$ maturity of the bond
    \item ED$_{floater}$ $\approx$ time (years) to next reset
\ee
\subsection{Describe the use of one-sided durations and key rate durations to 
evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options.}
\be
    \item One-sided Durations: when the bonds are at-the-money/near-the-money, changes in price
will be different for interest changing up or down. -- Durations that apply only when interet rise/fall.
    \item Key rate Duration/partial durations: capture the interest sensitivity of a bond
    to changes in yields(par rate) of specific benchmark maturities. Only one par rate is moved.
\ee
\subsection{Compare effective convexities of callable, putable, and straight bonds}
\be
    \item Callable: High rates\ra postive convexity; near the money\ra negative effective convexity
    \item Putable: Postivie effective convexity
    \item Straight: Positive effective convexity
\ee
\subsection{Describe defining features of a convertible bond.}
\be
    \item Convertible bonds: investor has rights to convert the bond into a fixed number of common stocks.
        \\-Conversion ratio = issue value / conversion price.
    \item Offer documents often provide a contingent put option in the event of change-of-control.
        \\-Hard option: redeem for cash; -Soft option: issuer decide to redeem for cash or stock.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate and interpret the components of a convertible bond's value}
\be
    \item Conversion value = market price of stock $\times$ conversion ratio
    \item Straight value: Investment value. PV of the bond's cash flow
    \item Minimum value of a convertible bond = max(conversion value, straight value)
    \item Market conversion price = mkt price of convertible bond/conversion ratio.
    \item Market conversion premium per share = mkt conversion price - stock's market price
    \item Market conversion premium ratio = market conversion premium per share / market price of common stock
    \item Premium over straight value = market price of convertible bond/straight value - 1
\ee
\subsection{Describe how a convertible bond is value in an arbitrage-free framework.}
\be
    \item Noncallable/nonputable convertible bond = an option-free bond + a call option on an
    amount of the common stock equal to the conversion ratio.
    \item Callable convertible bond value = straight value of bond + value of call option on stock - value
    of call option on bond
\ee
\subsection{Compare the risk-return characteristics of a convertible bond with the 
risk-return characteristics of a straight bond and of the underlying common stock}
\be
    \item Convertible bonds limits downside risk. Have to face: credit risk, call risk, 
    interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
    \item Conparison
        \be
            \item Stock price fall, returns on convertible bonds high
            \item Stock price rise, returns on convertible bonds low
        \ee
    \item Special case:
        \be
            \item Fixed-income equivalent/busted convertible: the price of common stock associated with
    a convertible issue is so low.
            \item Hybrid security: the price of the stock is high enough, and the price of 
            the convertible is like an equity security.
        \ee
    \item Bond Analytics: Output of pricing systems should follow:
        \be
            \item Put-call parity: C-P = PV(Forward price of the bond on exercise date) - PV(Exercise price)
            \item Option-free bond pricing: value of option-free bonds is independent of the volatility.

    \item Cost Approach: we won't pay more than it would cost to buy land and build a similar building
        \\-Good for new property, b/c it's hard to get the depreciation.
    \item Sales comparison approach: won't pay more than others pay for a similar property.
        \\- Good for single-family homes
    \item Income approach: = PV of future cash flows
        \\- Good for commercial real estates

\subsection{Estimate and interpret the inputs (for example, net operating income, capitalization
rate, and dicscount rate) to the direct capitalization) and discounted cash flow valuation methods.}
\subsection{Calculate the value of a property using the direct capitalization and discounted
cash flow valuation methods.}
Income Approach: 1) Direct capitalization method; 2) Discounted cash flow method.
\\Direct capitalization method
\be
    \item Direct Capitalization: capitalizing first year Net Operating Income using a capitalization rate.
    \\ NOI is before finance cost and income taxes.
    \\NOI = Rental income + Other income = Potential gross income - Vacancy and collection loss
    = Effective gross income - Operating expense(property tax, insurance, utilities, mainteinance)
     = Net operating income
    \item The Capitalization Rate
    \be
        \item Cap rate is applied on first-year NOI, discount rate is on first-year and future NOI.
        \item Cap rate = discount rate - growth rate, where growth rate is ``NOI/Value is expected to grow"
        \item Cap rate = NOI$_1$/Value = NOI$_1$/comparable sales price
        \item If renters pay all expense, value = rent$_1$/APY(All risk yield)
    \ee
    \item Stabilized NOI
    \be
    \item Temporary unusual NOI should be stabilized. 
    \item Temp Decline in NOI should be removed from the value calculated from the
    stabilized NOI.  
    \ee
    \item Gross income multiplier = sale price / gross income in the year after purchase
    \\Value = gross income $\times$ gross income multiplier
    \\- Property's vacancy rate and operating expenses are not included.
\ee
Discounted Cash Flow Method
\be
    \item Cap rate = discount rate - growth rate
    \item Value = V$_0$ = NOI$_1$/(r-g)
\ee
Terminal Cap Rate
\be
    \item Terms:
    \\Terminal value: The property value at the end of the holding period.
    \\Terminal cap rate: future cap rate
    \item Terminal Cap Rate is not necessarily the same as the going-in cap rate.
\ee
Valuation with Different Lease structures
\be
    \item Country difference. UK: tenants pay all expenses. 
    \item Reversionary potential: rent will adjust to the market price.Cap rent will be different
    from the market rent. Use different cap rate.
    \item Total value = PV of current term rent to be received + PV of Reversion potential.
\ee
Layer Method
\be
    \item a variation of the term and reversion approach.
    \item Total income = contract rent layer in perpetuity + rent increase
        \be
            \item Low cap rate for less risky layer
            \item High cap rate for the second layer, which is more risky.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Compare the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation
methods.}
Compare
\be
    \item Direct: a cap rate/income multiplier is on the first-year NOI. Cap rate may increase.
    \item DCF: Cash flows will be discounted.
\ee
\subsection{Calculate the value of a property using the costs and sales comparison approaches}
Cost Approach
\be
    \item Buyer pay = purchase of land + build a comparable building (replacement cost - depreciation)
    \item Depreciation including
    \\- Physical deterioration: First remove curable physical deterioration, then calculate
    \\- Functional obsolescene: like bad floor plans
    \\- Locational obsolescene: when the location is no longer optimal.
    \\- Economic obsolescene: New construction is not feasible under current economics.
\ee
Sales Comparison Approach
\be
    \item Buyer pay = others paying for a similar properties.
    \item Adjust. Average.
\ee
Reconciliation of Value
\be

        \\ Value-weighted index.
    \item Good
        \\- To Compare with other assets, 
    \item Bad
        \\- Lag actual transactions

private real estate investments.}
\be
    \item Debt service coverage ratio: DSCR = First-year NOI/Debt service

    \ee
    \item Office REITs
    \\ long, scheduled increasing leases.
    \\ Tenants pay part of property taxes, operating expenses, common  costs based on office size.
    \\ Consider location, transportation, and quality of the space

\subsection{Justify the use of net asset value per share (NAVPS) in REIT valuation and estimate
NAVPS based on forecasted cash net operating income.}
NAVPS: using current mkt values, net asset value - liabilities
\\ Estimating NAVPS based on FOrecasted Cash Net Operating Income
\be
    \item Step 1: Esimated first-year NOI is capitalized using a market cap rate. Note: 
    NOI should be the expected income in the comming year. Noncash rent should be removed.
    \item Step 2: + the value of other tangible assets - the value of liabilities

\ee
\subsection{Describe the use of funds from operations (FFO) and adjusted funds from operations
(AFFO) in REIT valuation}

    \item FFO = Accounting net earnings + Depreciation expense + Deferred tax expenses
    - Gains from sales of property and debt restructuring + Losses from sales and debt restructing
    \\ - A good measure of the continuing operating income
    \\ - Gains/Losses from debt restructuring or sales of property are removed, since they are not due to operating income.
    \item AFFO = FFO - Non-cash rent adjustment - Recurring maintenance-type capital expenditures
    and leasing commissons
    \\ - AKA: CAD(cash available for distribution) or FAD(funds available for distribution)
    \\ - Better measure

    \\- for growth of FFO or AFFO
    \\- The level of risks inherent in the underlying real estate
    \\- Risk related to the firm's leverage and access to capital

\be
    \item Discounted Cash Flow analysis: not good. Since it's hard to tell future cash flows
    in a VC company.
    \item Relative, market method: not good. Since VC companies are usually a unique company.
    \item Real option analysis method or the Venture capital method might be good.
\ee
\subsection{Explain alternative exit routes in private equity and their impact on value.}
Types of Exit Routes
\be
    \item IPO
    \\Highest exit value, greater access to equity and hire better managers
    \\less flexible, costly, cumbersome process

    \item Secondary market sale
    \\Sold to another investor
    \\Second highest company valuations
    \item Management buyout - MBOs
    \\ Sold to management, who utilize a large amoutn of leverge. Leverage results in less flexibility.
    \item Liquidation
    \\ Used when the company will fail
\ee
Exit timing
\be
    \item Be flexible to exit. Should sell the company when the capital market is strong.
    \item If an exit is expected in the next 1 year or 2, the exit valuation multiple can be forecasted.
    Big error will be possible beyond this time horizon.

Corporate Governance Terms of a Private Equtiy Fund
\be
    \item Key man clauses: If the key man leaves, GP cannot invest.

    GP will return a portion of the early profits.
    \item Distribution waterfall, there are two methods 
    \\- Deal-by-deal: carriered interest to be distributed after each deal.
    \\- Total-return: Pay the carriered interest when the portfolio is greater than total commited equity .OR. 
    the portfolio grows to some specific value, 20\% ususally.
    \item Tag-along, drag-along clauses: Anytime, the acquirered offer should be extended to all shareholders.
    \item No-fault divource: Fire a GP if a supermajority of the LPs agree.
    \item Removal for cause: Fire the GP or terminate a fund given sufficient cause.
    \item Investment restrictions
    \item Co-investment: allows the LPs to invest in other funds of the GP at low or no management fees.
\ee
Net Asset Value (NAV): Private equity investments are difficult to value, the 
\be
    \item 6 Ways to determine NAV
    \\1. At cost, adjusting for subsequient financing and devaluation
    \\2. At the minimum of cost or market value
    \\3. Revaluing a portfolio company when there's new financing
    \\4. At cost, with no adjustment until exit
    \\5. By using a discount factor for restricted securities
    \\6. Less frequently, by applying illiquidity discounts to values based on
    public companies.
    \item Issues in calculating NAV
    \\1. NAV is only adjusted when there are subsequent financing
    \\2. No definitive method to calculate NAV
    \\3. Undrawn LP capital are not included in NAV, but it's actually liability
    \\4. Different stages will use different value methods
    \\6. It's the GP who values the fund usually.
\ee
Due diligence
\be
    \item Private equity funds tend to persist historical returns.
    \item Duration is usually sharter than expected,though the term is longer.
\ee
\subsection{Explain risks and costs of investing in private equity.
}
\be
    \item Difference between investing private/public firms
    \\-In private euqity, the commitment equity are commmited first, THEN drawn down
    to be invested to portfolio companies.
    \\-Returns in private investment follows J-curve: negative first, then positive when
    exiting.
\ee
Risks of Investing in Private Equity:
\\-General Risk Factors:
\be
    \item Liqudity Risk
    \item Unquoted investment risk: do not have a publicly quoted price
    \item Competitive environment risk
    \item Angency risk: Managers of private equity portfolio companies may not act in the
    best interest of the private equity firm and investors.
    \item Capital risks: Increases in business risk may result in capital withdrawal.
    \item Regulatory risk: Portfolio companies products and services may be adversely affected by government regulation.
    \item Tax risks
    \item Valuation risk: subjective valuation of private equity investments
    \item Diversification risk
    \item Market risk: long-term changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and other market risks
\ee
Costs of Private Equity
\be
    \item Transaction costs
    \item Investment vehicle fund setup costs: costs of setting up the fund are amortized.
    \item Administrative costs
    \item Audit costs
    \item Management and performance costs: 2\% for the management and 20\% for performance
    \item Dilution Costs
    \item Placement fees: placement agents who raise funds will charge fees.
\ee
\subsection{Interpret and compare financial performance of private equity funds from 
the perspective of an investor.}
IRR: 
\be
    \item NOTE: IRR assumes that intermediate cash flows are reinvested at the IRR.
    \item Gross IRR: relavant for the cash flows between the fund and portfolio companies.
    \item Net IRR: IRR that net of management fees, carried interestes, and other compensation to
    the GP. Relavant for the cash flows between the fund and LPs.
\ee
Multiples:
\be
    \item NOTE: Multiples ignore the time value of money.
    \item Quantitative Measures
    \\-PIC(Paid-in capital): ratio between the paid-in capital to the committed capital; .OR.
    the cumulative capital utilized
    \\-DPI(distributed to paid-in capital.): Cumulative distributions paid to LPs divided
    by the cumulative invested capital. Net of mg fees and carried interests.
    \\-RVPI(Residual value to paid-in capital): LP's unrealized return. The value of the LP's holdings
    divided by the cummulative invested capital. Net of managemtn fees and carried interest.
    \\-TVPI(total value to paid-in capital)=DPI+RVPI
    \item Qualitative Measures
    \\-The realized investments, with evaluaiton of success and failure
    \\-Unrealized investments, with evaluatin of exit horizons and potential problems.
    \\Cash flow projections at the fund and portfolio company level
    \\Fund valuation, NAV, and finanical statements.

\subsection{Demonstrate alternative methods to account for risk in venture capital}
Input variables should be adjusted because projections by entrepreneurs 
are typically overly optimistic and based on assumptions that the company will not fail.
\be
    \item Adjusting the Discount Rate
    $$
        r^*=\frac{1+r}{1-q}-1
    $$
    Where $q$ is the probability of failure.

    \item Excess return swap: Buy it, and recevie periodic payments of any percentage
    by which the commodity price exceeds some benchmark value. If price $<$ fixed value, no payments
    are made.
    \item Basis swap: Based on difference between the prices of two commodities. Usually, one has liquied
    traded futures for hedging, the other with no liquid futures contracts.
    \item Commodity volatility swap: the underlying factor is the volatility of the

\subsection{Describe and compare macroeconomic factor models, fundamental factor models, and
statistical factor models.}
Classifications of models

    \item Macroeconomic factor models: returns are due to the SURPRISE in macroeconomic models.
    \item Fundamental factor models: Firm specific factors
    \item Statistical factor models: 
        \\ - Factor analysis: covariance
        \\ - Principal component models: varianc
\ee
Macroeconomic Factor Models
\be
    \item Model
    $$
        R_i = E(R_i) + b_{i1}F_{GDP} + b_{i2}F_{QS} + \varepsilon_i
    $$
    where $E(R_i)$= Expected return of asset i, $F_{GDP}$ is the surprise in the GDP rate,
    $F_{QS}$ = the surprise in the credit quality yield(BB-rated - Treasury bond yield).
    \item Priced Risk Factors
        \\ - unsystematic risks will be be rewarded.
        \\ - GDP rate and credit quality risks are systematic risks.
    \item Factor sensitivities
        \\ - Can be estimated by regressing historical asset returns on the corresponding hisotrical
        macroeconomic factors.
\ee
Fundamental Factor Models
\be
    \item Model
     $$
        R_i = a_i + b_{i1}F_{P/E}+b_{i2}F_{SIZE}+\varepsilon_i

            \\ Factor return = $\sum_{i=1}^k (\beta_{pi}-\beta_{bi})\times\lambda_i$
            \\ Security seleciton return = active return - factor return
    \item Risk Attribution
        \\ Active risk = tracking error = $\sigma(R_p-R_B)$
        \\ Active risk squared = active factor risk + active specific risk
        \be
            \item Active factor risk: Difference of sensitivities between portfolio
             factors and benchmark.
                \\ Active factor risk = active risk squared - active specific risk
            \item Active specific risk: Asset selection. Due to the weights of stocks
             you use.
                \\ Active specific risk = $\sum_i^n(W_{pi}-W_{b})^2\sigma_{\varepsilon i}^2$
                where $W_pi$ are portfolio weights, and $\sigma_{\varepsilon i}^2$ = 
                residual risk of the ith asset. 
        \ee
    \item Use of Multifactor Models
        \be
            \item For Passive Management: Construct a tracking portfolio, expose to
            same factors as the benchmark.
            \item Active management: make specific bets on desired factors while hedging/neutral on
            other factors.
            \item Rules-based/algorithmic active management: mechanically tilt factor exposures when constructing
            portfolios.
        \ee
\ee
Carhart Model
\be
    \item Model
    $$
        E(R) = R_F + \beta_1 RMRF + \beta_2 SMB + \beta_3 HML + beta_4 WML
    $$
    \\ $RMRF$ = return on value-weighted equity index - risk-free rate
    \\ $SMB$ = average return on small cap stock - average return on large cap stocks
    \\ $HML$ = average return on high book-to-market sotcks - average return on low-book-to-market stocks

    lose at least \$25,000 in any given month
    \item In percentage: The monthly 5\% Var is 3\% \ra There is 5\% probability that the portfolio
    value will lose at least 3\%
\ee
\subsection{Compare the parametric (variance-covariance), historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simultion
methods for estimating VaR.}
\subsection{Esimate and interpret VaR under the parametric, historical simulation and Monte Carlo
simulation methods.}
Three methods
\be
    \item Paramteric Method(Variance-covariance method)
    \be
        \item Identify the risk factors related to the portfolio returns: market risk, interest
        rate risk, or currency risk, etc.
        \item Assumption:
            \\ - Risk factors are distributed normally
        \item $$
            \sigma_{portfolio}^2=W_A^2\sigma_A^2+W_A^2\sigma_A^2+2W_A W_B Cov_{AB}
        $$
        \\ - Lookback period: time horizon to estimate the mean and standard deviation of returns.
        \item 1\% \ra -2.33$\sigma$
        5\% \ra \ra -1.645$\sigma$
        16\% \ra -1$\sigma$
    \ee
    \item Historical simulation method
    \be
        \item Based on the actual periodic changes in risk factors over a lookback period.
        \\ - Calculate a daily change, ordering the changes, we will have 5\% of losses. No adjustment needed.
    \ee
    \item Monte Carlo simulation
    \be
        \item Assum probability distribution for each risk factor. Assume the correlations between
        risk factor.
    \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe advantages and limitations of VaR}
Advantage of Var
\be
    \item Simple, easy to explain
    \item Help compare risks of different portfolios, asset classes
    \item Use for performance evaluation
    \item Allocating assets, the risk managers can look at/optimize the allocation of VaR
    \item Global banking regulators accept VaR as a measure of financial risk
    \item VaR can be verified by backtesting
\ee
Disadvantage of Var
\be
    \item VaR estimation requires many choices
    \item The assumption of normality \ra Underestimates of downside risk. Actual return have fatter
    tails than normal risk.
    \item Liquidity falls significantly when asset price fall. VaR dos not include this.
    \item VaR didn't include that Correlations increase during periods of financial stress.
    \item Ignore many risk
    \item VaR didn't look at right-hand tail
\ee
\subsection{Describe extension of VaR}
Extension of VaR
\be
    \item Conditional VaR (CVaR): Expected loss GIVEN the loss is equal or greater than VaR.
    \item Incremental VaR (IVaR): Change in VaR from a change in the portfolio allocation weight of a seruity.
    \item Marginal VaR (MVaR): The slope of VaR vs. a seurity's weight
    \item Ex ante tracking error, aka Relative VaR: Measures the VaR of the difference between the return on a
    portfolio and the return on its manager's benchmark portfolio.
\ee
\subsection{Describe sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures and compare
these measures to VaR}
We should use other risk measures that complement VaR.  
\be
    \item Sensitivity Analysis: Assess the effect on portfolio value given a small change in one risk factor.
        \\ - Provides an estimate of the change in portfolio value due to a small change in a single risk factor.
        \\ - It does not involve any prediction.    
    \item Scenario analysis
        \\ - Provides an estimate of the effect on portfolio value of a set of changes of
        significant magnitude in multiple risk factors.
        \\ Approaches
        \be
        \item  Historical scenario: use a set of changes in risk factors that HAVE occured.
        \item Hypothetical scenario: any set of changes in risk factors can be used.
        \item Stress test: examine the effect on value of a scenario of extreme risk-factor changes.

\subsection{Demonstrate how equity, fixed income, and optinos exposure measures may be 
used in measuring and managing market risk and volatility risk.}
Factors used in measurment
\be
    \item Equity: beta. $E(R_i) = Beta_i[E(R_{MKT})-R_f]$
    \item Fixed income: Modified Duration \ra How market values are affected by changes in interest rate.
        \\ Change in price = -Duration($\Delta_Y$)+1/2 Convexity($\Delta_Y)^2$
        \be
            \item Maculay Duration: Time weighted-average of PV of future cash flows.
            \item Modified Duration: $\partial(Value)/\partial(y)$
            \item Compounding methods
            \\  -  Continuous compounding: modified = Maculay
            \\  -  Period compouding: Modified = Maculay/(1+Yield per period)
        \ee
    \item Options: 
        \be
            \item Delta: Sensitivity of option values to changes in the value of underlying asset. 
            \item Gamma: Delta changes as the price of the underlying asset changes
            \item Vega: Option values to changes in the expected volatility of the price of the underlying asset.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Describe the use of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures.}
Uses
\be
    \item Sensitivity risk measures: inform a portfolio manager about a portfolio's exposure to
    various risk factors.
    \item Scenario analysis: Often modeled as instant scenario changes. In some case, it's incremental
    changes, and includes manager's reaction.
    \item Reverse stress testing: Decide an unacceptable outcome, then find how likely the related scenario
    would happen. 
\ee
\subsection{Describe advantages and limitations of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures.}
VaR, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis complement each other.\\
Advantages
\be
    \item VaR provides a probability of loss
    \item Sensitivity: relative exposures to different risk Factors
    \item Scenario: information about exposure to instant changes
\ee
Limitations
\subsection{Describe risk measures used by banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers.}
\be
    \item Banks: sensitivity(held-to-maturity and foreign exchange risk), scenario and stress testing(full balance sheet),
     leverage risk measures, and VaR(trading securities)
    \item Traditional(long-only) asset managers: relative risk measures, size of positions, sensitivity measures, scenario analysis.
        \\- Active share: difference between the weight in portfolio and the weight in benchmark.
        \\- Ex-post tracking error(backward looking), ex-ante tracking error(forward looking): ex-ante tracking error
        can be used for risk estimation.
    \item Hedge funds: Dependes. Sensitivity analysis, leverage measures, scenario analysis, and stress test.
        \\- If the fund with significantly non-normal returns: Use ``Maximum Drawdown"\ra The largest
        decrease in value over prior periods of a specific length.
    \item Defined benefit pension funds: Use ``Surplus-at-risk" \ra VaR for (plan asset - liability)
    \item Insurance companies
        \\ - Property and casualty insurers: 
        \be
            \item Use sensitivties of exposures to market risk factors in investment portfolios for risk managements.
            \item Use VaR and capital at risk, scenario analysis,  as measures
        \ee
         - Life insureers: 
        \be
            \item Risks more correlated with the market. Because life insurers invest more. Annuities
            pay over long periods into the future.
        \ee
\ee
\subsection{Explain constraints used in managing market risks, including risk budgeting, position limits, scenario
limits, and stop-loss limits.}
\be
    \item Risk budgeting: Determine the acceptable total risk, then allocate them to different activities, strategies, assets.
    \item Position limits: Ensure minimum level of diversification by limiting risk exposures.
    \item Scenario limits: limits on expected loss for a given scenario
    \item Stop-loss limits: require risk exposures be reduced if losses exceed a specified amount.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how risk measures may be used in capital allocation decisions.}
Capital allocation: how the capital of a firm is used to fund its business.
\be
    \item No risk management: maximize the companies' expected return.
    \item With risk exposures: One way is to limit the overall risk of all the activities.
\ee



\section{Economics and Investment Markets}
\subsection{Explain the notion that to affect market values, economic factors must affect one or more of the following:(1)
default-free interest rates across matuities, (2)the timing and/or magnitute of expected
cash flows, and (3)risk premiums}
The value of any asset will change if
\be
    \item expected cash flow change
    \item discount rate change
        \\ - Real risk-free discount rate
        \\ - Expected inflation ($\pi$)
        \\ - Risk premium reflecting the uncertainty about the cash flows
\ee
\subsection{Explain the role of expectations and changes in expectations in market valutation.}
Expectations will change if new information is acquired. The impact of new information will depenced on
current expectation.
\subsection{Explain the relationship between the long-term growth rate of the economy, the volatility
of the growth rate, and the average level of real short-term interest rates.}
Real risk-free rate of interest derives from the inter-temporal rate of substitution
\be
    \item 
    $$
        \text{inter-temporal rate of substituion} = m_t =
        \frac{\text{marginal utility of consuming 1 unit in the future}}
        {\text{marginal utility of current consumption of 1 unit}}=\frac{u_t}{u_0}
    $$
    \item Current price of a zero-coupon, inflation-indexed, risk-free bond pay \$1 at time $t$
    $$
        P_0=E(m_t)
    $$
    $$
        R=\frac{1-P_0}{P_0}=\frac{1}{E(m_t)}-1
    $$
    \item Some key points
    \be
        \item If investors expect high income in the future, they will save less, consume more\ra High utility of current
        consumption, high interest
        \item low income in the future\ra less consumption, high savings, low interest
        \item Investor increase their savings when i) Expected returns are high or ii)when
        uncertainty about their future income increases. 
    \ee
\ee
Risky Cash Flows and Risk premiums
\be
    \item Risk premium: if the expected cash flows are uncertain, premium is needed.
    \item Risk-aversion: investor experiences a LARGER loss of untility for a loss, SMALLER gain in
    utility for an equivalent gain in wealth.
        \\ Risk-aversion declines with wealth. Wealthier people are less risk averse.
        \\ For a risk-free, inflated-indexed, zero-coupon bond that an investor will sell prior
        to maturity: 
        $$
            P_0=\frac{E(P_1)}{1+R}+cov(P_1,m_1)
        $$
        where $E(P_1)$ is the expected sell price.
        \\ Cov($P_1$,$m_1$)<0. Because if the expected future price of the asset is high,
        the marginal utility of future consumption relative to current consumption will be low.
        \\ Negative cov\ra postive risk premium
\ee
GDP Growth Rates:
\be
    \item High GDP\ra High future income expected\ra Low utility of future consumption\ra High interest rate
    \item Real interest rate is positvely correlated to the GDP Growth rate; also positively correlated
    with the expected volatility in GDP growth due to higher risk premium.
\ee
\subsection{Explain how the phase of the business cycle affects policy and hosrt-term interest
rates, the slope of the term structure of interest rates, and the relative performance
of bonds of differeing maturities.}
Nominal risk-free interest rates should include inflation, as well as the Uncertainty of inflation.
\be
    \item Short-term, uncertainty about inflation is negligible. 
        $$
            r(short-term) = R+\pi
        $$
    \item Long-term,:
        $$
            r(long-term) = R+\pi+\theta
        $$
        $\pi$ is the expected inflation. $\theta$ is the risk premium for uncertainty about inflation.
\ee
Taylor Rule
\be
    \item Model:
    $$
        r = R_n + \pi + 0.5(\pi-\pi^*) = 0.5(y-y^*)
    $$
    Where $R_n$ is the neutral REAL policy interest rate, $\pi^*,y^*$ are the targeted
    inflation rate and targeted sustainable output.
\ee
Business Cycle and Slope of the Yield Curve
\be
    \item Recession \ra Low policy rates
    \item Economy comes out of recession \ra Improved expectations about future GDP growth
    \ra Higher long-term rates \ra Positive slope of the yield curve.
    \item Expectations of a decline in GDP growth results in a negatiely sloped yield curve.
    \item Term spread: difference between the yield on a longer-term bond yield and the yield on a 
    short-term bond. Normally positive. Since larger uncertainty in inflation.
\ee
\subsection{Describe the factors that affect yield spreads between non-infaltion-adjusted and inflation-indexed bonds}
Break-evein inflation rate (BEI)
\be
    \item BEI = yield on non-infaltion-indexed bond - yield on inflation-indexed bond
    \item BEI = $\pi + \theta$
\ee
\subsection{Explain how the phase of the business cycle affects credit spreads and the performance of credit-sensitive
fixed-income instruments}
Required rate of return for credit risky bonds
\be
    \item = $R + \pi + \theta + \gamma$
\ee
Where $\gamma$=additional risk premium for credit risk = credit spread
\subsection{Explain how the characteristics of the market for a company's products affect
the company's credit quality.}
Credit spreads differs among industrial sectors, due to products, service, and different financial levarge.
\subsection{Explain how the phase of the business cycle affects short-term and long-term earnings growth expectations}
Cyclical industries(durable goods, consumer discretionay) are more sensitve to the phase.
Non-cyclical industries are immune to fluctuatoins, earnings relatively stable.
\subsection{Explain the relationship between the consumtion-hedging properties of equity and the equity risk premium.}
\be
\item Discount rate for equtiy = R + $\pi$ + $\theta$ + $\gamma$ + $\kappa$, where $\kappa$ = additonal risk premium
relative to risky debt for an investment in equities.
\\ $\lambda$ = equity risk premium =$\gamma + \kappa$
\item 
     - Consumption hedging property: Higher payoff during economic downturns. \ra Reduce the risk premium
    \\ - Equity: high value when economic expansions, and the marginal utility of consumption is lower. Risk premium is positive.
\ee
\subsection{Describe cyclical effects on valuation multiples.}
\be
    \item Multiples are positively corerelated with expected earnings growth rates and negatively
    correlted to required returns. Price multiples increase with a decrease in components of required return
    (real rate, expected inflation, risk premium for inflation uncertainty, equity risk premium.)
    \item Equity risk premium decline during expansion.
    \item Shiller's CAPE(real cyclically adjusted P/E) = voliatilty of unadjusted P/E ratio - (real price/10-yr real earnings)
\ee
\subsection{Describe the implications of the business cycle for a given style strategy.(Value, growth,
small Cap, large Cap)}
\be
    \item Growth stock: high P/E, low dividend, immature markets
    \item Value stocks: how P/E, high yield, mature markets.
\ee
Stragey
\be
    \item Growth stragty: investing in growth stocks. Good during expansion.
    \item Value: investing in value stocks. Good during recession.
    \item small/mid/large cap: small cap \ra higher volativlity, high risk-premium
\ee
\subsection{Describe how economic analysis is used in sector rotation stragies.}
Choose right sector to invest in different phase of economic cycles.
\subsection{Describe the economic factors affecting investment in commercial real estate.}
Commercial real estate investments
\be
    \item Bond-like: steady rental income, credit quality for tenants
    \item Equity-like: value of estates is influenced by many factors. Uncertain terminal value.
    \item Illiquity
\ee
Valuation
\\Discount rate for equtiy = R + $\pi$ + $\theta$ + $\gamma$ + $\kappa$ + $\phi$, 
where $\phi$ = risk premium for illiquidity.
